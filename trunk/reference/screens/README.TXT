Room 321 / The Squirrel's Nest - Q-Link Load Screens
           
Remembering Q-Link!

QuantumLink, better known as Q-Link, was an online service for Commodore
64/128 computers. It was in operation from November 1st, 1985 to October
31st, 1994 and it was operated by Quantum Computer Services which later
changed its name to America Online.

Q-Link, like AOL, used custom software. Because of the 64's limited memory
different programs had to be loaded as you moved from one department to
another. Since disk access was slow, even with the built in "fast" loader,
the load time could be a half minute or longer. The GIFs in this collection
are the screens that were displayed while the software was loading.

I used the C64S emulator to save the screens in .BMP format and then
converted the .BMPs to .GIFs.

The Club Caribe Load Screen is also (c)1989 Lucasfilm Ltd.
