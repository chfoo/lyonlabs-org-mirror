ÔHE ÄEFAULT OPTION WILL          RESTORE A SET OF TABS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SAVED WITH THE          ÓTORE OPTION.  ÔHE STORED TABS ARE SAVED TO DISK WITH OTHER SETUP          PARAMETERS.          ÎÏÔÅ: ×HEN YOU ARE USING ÖÔ102 EMULATION, BE AWARE THAT SOME          REMOTE SYSTEMS WILL RESET THE TABS AS PART OF THE LOGON SEQUENCE.          7.9 ÔRANSMIT ÅÏÌ           ----------------                ÁNOTHER BIG PROBLEM AREA IN COMMUNICATIONS IS THE LACK OF          ANY CLEAR STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO END-OF-LINE CHARACTERS.  ÔO          HELP OVERCOME THIS TROUBLE, ÄESÔERM ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT WHAT          EXACTLY IS SENT WHEN YOU PRESS ÒETURN OR ÅNTER.  ÉF YOU WISH          ÒETURN TO SEND ONLY ÃÈÒ$(13), SELECT ÔX ÅÏÌ = ÃÒ, OR IF YOU WISH          TO SEND A CARRIAGE RETURN & LINEFEED PAIR, SELECT ÔØ ÅÏÌ = ÃÒ/ÌÆ.          7.10 ÒECEIVE ÅÏÌ           ----------------                ÉN THE SAME MANNER AS ÔRANSMIT ÅÏÌ, ÒECEIVE ÅÏÌ ALLOWS YOU          TO DECIDE HOW ÄESÔERM WILL INTERPRET A RECEIVED CARRIAGE RETURN.           ÉF YOU WISH ÄESÔERM TO SIMPLY MOVE TO THE START OF THE CURRENT          LINE WHEN IT RECEIVES A CARRIAGE RETURN, SELECT ÒX ÅÏÌ = ÃÒ.  ÏR          IF YOU WOULD LIKE ÄESÔERM TO MOVE TO THE START OF THE NEXT LINE,          SELECT ÒX ÅÏÌ = ÃÒ/ÌÆ.          ÎÏÔÅ:  ÓETTING BOTH ÒX AND ÔX TO INCLUDE LINEFEEDS IS THE          EQUIVALENT TO SETTING ÖÔ102 ÎÅ×ÌÉÎÅ MODE ÏÎ.  ÖÔ102 COMMANDS          EXIST TO SET THIS MODE FROM REMOTE; BE AWARE THAT THIS CAN          HAPPEN.          ÃOMMODORE ÇRAPHICS MODE REQUIRES THAT ÒECEIVE ÅÏÌ BE SET TO THE          'ÒX ÅÏÌ = ÃÒ/ÌÆ' OPTION (WHICH IS AUTOMATICALLY DONE WHEN YOU          SELECT ÃOMMODORE MODE).          7.11 ÃOLOUR ÍODE           ----------------                ÓOME APPLICATIONS REQUIRE MUCH SCROLLING OF THE SCREEN.           ÅVEN THOUGH ÄESÔERM USES ITS OWN CUSTOM SCREEN HANDLING ROUTINES,          IT SOMETIMES LAGS BEHIND AT HIGHER SPEEDS.  ÉT IS POSSIBLE TO          DOUBLE THE SPEED OF EVERYTHING DISPLAYED BY TELLING ÄESÔERM NOT          TO BOTHER WITH KEEPING TRACK OF THE COLOURS OF THE CHARACTERS          ONSCREEN.  ÆOR MOST ÖÔ102 APPLICATIONS, THIS WILL NOT BE A          PROBLEM SINCE COLOUR IS NOT USED ANYWAY.  ÔHE PROBLEM IS THAT THE          ÖÔ102 ATTRIBUTES (FLASH, UNDERLINE, REVERSE VIDEO AND BRIGHT) ARE          CONSIDERED TO BE COLOUR AND THEREFORE ALSO NOT UPDATED.  ÉF YOU          REQUIRE BOTH COLOUR AND HIGH SPEED TRANSMISSIONS, BE SURE TO TELL          ÄESÔERM TO USE ØON/ØOFF HANDSHAKING.                                          30          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          7.12 ÓCREEN ÌENGTH           ------------------                  ÔO BE COMPATIBLE WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS,          ÄESÔERM ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT HOW MANY SCREEN LINES YOU WISH TO          USE.  ÔHE 23, 24 AND 25 LINE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN NORMAL          MODE, BUT TO DISPLAY 50, 51 AND 52 LINES, INTERLACE MODE IS USED.           ÉNTERLACE MODE MEANS THAT THE CHARACTERS WILL BE HALF THE HEIGHT          OF WHAT THEY NORMALLY ARE, BUT THEY SHOULD BE READABLE ON MOST          MONITORS.  ÔHE SCREEN WILL ALSO APPEAR TO FLICKER, WHICH MAY BE          LESSENED TO SOME EXTENT BY ADJUSTING THE CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS          CONTROLS.  ÙOU MAY USE THE 'ÁDJUST ÖÄÃ ÍODE' OPTION IN THE          ÅNVIRONMENT ÍENU TO FINE TUNE THE INTERLACE SETTINGS TO YOUR          SYSTEM.          ÎÏÔÅ:  ÉT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO USE INTERLACE MODE AND ÔHICK ÐIXEL          MODE TOGETHER (THE OPTION THAT IS SELECTED LAST TAKES          PRECEDENCE!).          7.13 ÓCREEN ×IDTH           -----------------                ÔHE SCREEN WIDTH MAY BE SET TO EITHER 40 OR 80 COLUMNS.           ÍOST APPLICATIONS WILL REQUIRE A FULL 80 COLUMNS, BUT SOME          APPLICATIONS WILL WORK BEST IN 40-COLUMN MODE (SUCH AS WHEN YOU          ARE USING ÃOMMODORE 64 BULLETIN BOARDS).          ÎÏÔÅ:  ÔHIS MODE SIMPLY TELLS ÄESÔERM HOW MANY ÌÏÇÉÃÁÌ COLUMNS          THERE ARE PER LINE (IE.

ÉF YOU ARE USING A SCREEN          WIDTH OF 40 COLUMNS, YOU MAY WISH TO ALSO SELECT ÔHICK ÐIXEL          MODE, SO THAT THE 40 COLUMNS FILL THE ENTIRE SCREEN.  ÉF YOU WANT          TO USE ÔHICK ÐIXEL AND 80 COLUMN MODE TOGETHER (GOOD FOR THE          VISION IMPAIRED), YOU MAY ONLY SEE HALF THE SCREEN AT A TIME.  ÔO          DISPLAY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, PRESS ÁÌÔ WITH THE LEFT          CURSOR KEY.  ÔO DISPLAY THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, PRESS ÁÌÔ          WITH THE RIGHT CURSOR KEY.
