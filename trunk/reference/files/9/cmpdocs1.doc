ÔHE 'Ä' LANGUAGE OFFERS MANY FACILITIES          USEFUL FOR AUTOMATIC LOGON PROCEDURES AND MESSAGE BUFFERING.          1.1 ÄISTRIBUTION ÎOTICE          -----------------------                ÄESÔERM IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE ÓÈÁÒÅ×ÁÒÅ CONCEPT, A          METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING HIGH QUALITY SOFTWARE TO THE USER AT LOW          COST.  ×HEN YOU START TO USE THIS PROGRAM, YOU HAVE A SHORT          EVALUATION PERIOD IN WHICH TO MUST DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE          USING THE PROGRAM.

ÔHE AUTHOR          ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY DAMAGE, DIRECT OR          INCIDENTAL, RESULTING FROM THEIR USE.           2 ÇETTING STARTED          -----------------               ÓINCE THE COMPILER IS A ÄESÔERM OVERLAY, YOU MUST BE RUNNING          ÄESÔERM IN ORDER TO USE THE COMPILER.  ÔHIS IS NOT A PROBLEM          SINCE IN MOST CASES YOU WILL BE USING THE BUFFER EDITOR TO EDIT          THE SCRIPT FILES ANYWAY.  ÉN ORDER TO GET THE COMPILER IN MEMORY,          YOU ÍÕÓÔ FIRST RESERVE ROOM FOR IT.  ÔHIS IS DONE BY SELECTING          'ÏVERLAYS & ÂUFFER' FOR THE 'ÏVERLAYS/ÂUFFER' IN THE ÕSER          ÅNVIRONMENT MENU.  ÎEXT, YOU MUST LOAD THE COMPILER CODE INTO          MEMORY WITH THE ÌOAD ÏVERLAY OPTION IN THE 'ÅDIT ÄEFAULTS' MENU.           ÔHE FILENAME IS 'COMP.OVL'.  ÔO RUN THE COMPILER SIMPLY SELECT          'ÏVERLAY ÓTART'.  ÎÏÔÅ:  ÉF YOU WISH TO HAVE THE COMPILER LOAD          AUTOMATICALLY WHENEVER YOU USE ÄESÔERM, SIMPLY LOAD IT AND SELECT          'ÓAVE ÎAMES' IN THE ÅDIT DEFAULTS MENU.          3  ×HAT CAN 'Ä' DO FOR YOU?          ---------------------------               ÔHE 'Ä' SCRIPT LANGUAGE WILL HELP YOU IN TWO DISTINCT AREAS:          1)   ÙOU MAY CREATE A SCRIPT THAT ÄESÔERM WILL AUTOMATICALLY               EXECUTE WHEN IT FIRST STARTS.  ÔHIS PROGRAM IS NORMALLY USED               TO AUTOMATICALLY SETUP THE RAMDISK AND COPY THE NECESSARY               ÄESÔERM FILES TO IT.  ÔHE FILE IS CALLED 'STARTUP' AND IS               COMPILED TO BECOME 'DSL.STARTUP'.  ÌOOK IN THE DISTRIBUTION               PACKAGE FOR THE EXAMPLE 'STARTUP' FILE.          2)   ÔHE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE SCRIPT LANGUAGE IS TO MAKE LOGGING               ONTO BULLETIN BOARD SERVICES MUCH EASIER.  ÙOU CAN TELL               ÄESÔERM TO AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTE A GIVEN SCRIPT WHEN IT               CONNECTS TO A ÂÂÓ.  ÔHE SCRIPT CAN AUTOMATICALLY LOG ON AND               WADE THROUGH THE WELCOME AND BULLETIN SCREENS.  ÙOU CAN EVEN               CONTROL THE OPERATION OF THE CAPTURE BUFFER, SO THAT YOU CAN               GET ÄESÔERM TO SAVE ALL YOUR MESSAGES FOR LATER READING               OFFLINE.               ÌEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE IS ALWAYS A TRIFLE DIFFICULT AT          FIRST.  ÔHE 'Ä' LANGUAGE HAS A VERY SIMPLE GRAMATIC STRUCTURE AND          THERE ARE NO COMPLEX STRUCTURES TO REMEMBER.  ÅACH KEYWORD HAS          ONLY ONE MEANING, AND THERE IS ONLY EVER ONE KEYWORD TO EACH          COMMAND.  ÔHE EASIEST WAY TO LEARN ANY LANGUAGE IS BY EXAMPLE.          ÓEVERAL EXAMPLE SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ÄESÔERM                                          2          'Ä' ÓCRIPT ÃOMPILER Ö1.00                              ÊULY 1990          PACKAGE.               ÔHE ACTION OF LOGGING INTO A ÂÂÓ, AND MOVING AROUND WITHIN          IT IS A VERY SIMPLE TASK TO HUMANS.  ×E SIMPLY MONITOR THE          INCOMING TEXT (SUCH AS MENUS OR PROMPTS) AND TYPE THE RESPONSE          CORRESPONDING TO WHAT WE WISH TO DO.  ÉN ORDER FOR A COMPUTER TO          DO THE SAME TASK, WE MUST INFORM THE COMPUTER THE SORT OF THINGS          TO EXPECT, AND THE RESPONSES TO MAKE TO THEM.  ÔHE 'Ä' LANGUAGE          OFFERS SEVERAL METHODS TO ACCOMPLISH THE LOGON TASK.  ÔHE ×ÁÉÔ          COMMAND WILL HALT THE PROGRAM UNTIL THE SPECIFIED TEXT STRING IS          TRANSMITTED BY THE ÂÂÓ.  ÔHE ÐÒÏÍÐÔ COMMAND WILL SEND A SPECIFIED          STRING AT REGULAR INTERVALS UNTIL ANOTHER STRING IS RECEIVED.           ÔHIS COMMAND IS USEFUL WHEN THE SCRIPT FIRST CONNECTS TO A ÂÂÓ          (THEY OFTEN REQUIRE THAT ÒÅÔÕÒÎ BE PRESSED).  ÔHE ÅÍÉÔ COMMAND          WILL SEND THE SPECIFIED STRING TO THE REMOTE SYSTEM.  ÔHIS IS          NORMALLY USED AFTER A ×ÁÉÔ STATEMENT AND IS OFTEN USED FOR          SENDING THE NAME AND PASSWORD ETC.  ÔHESE COMMANDS ARE USEFUL FOR          SITUATIONS IN WHICH YOU CAN PREDICT THE ORDER OF EVENTS, BUT NOT          IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE PROMPTS MAY VARY.  ÍANY OPENING BULLETINS          CONSIST OF EVER CHANGING MESSAGE TEXTS.  ÓOMETIMES THEY ARE ONLY          ONE SCREEN LONG, AND OTHER TIMES THEY ARE MANY SCREENS LONG.           ÔHERE ARE OFTEN SEVERAL PROMPTS FOR WHICH A RESPONSE IS NEEDED          (SUCH AS 'ÍORE?', 'ÐRESS ÅÎÔÅÒ TO CONTINUE' AND 'ÐRESS ANY KEY'),          ANY OF WHICH COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME.  ÉN SUCH CASES IT IS          IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT.  ÔO OVERCOME THIS          PROBLEM, ÄESÔERM INCLUDES COMMANDS THAT CAN ACT ON SEVERAL          STIMULI.  ÆOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN TELL ÄESÔERM TO RESPOND TO THE          THREE EXAMPLES ABOVE IN TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAYS.  ÐEOPLE THAT HAVE          PROGRAMMED IN Ã OR ÐASCAL WILL RECOGNIZE THIS AS A ÃÁÓÅ          STRUCTURE.                     3.1 ÔHE 'Ä' SCRIPT LANGUAGE          ---------------------------               ÔHE 'Ä' LANGUAGE IS A LINE ORIENTED LANGUAGE, WITH EACH LINE          CONSISTING OF A COMMAND POSSIBLY FOLLOWED BY SOME PARAMETERS.           ÅACH LINE IS FREE FORM, MEANING THAT INDENTATION FOR LOOP          STRUCTURES CAN BE USED (AND IS ENCOURAGED). ÔHE LANGUAGE CONSISTS          OF 26 COMMANDS AND 1 DIRECTIVE.  ÐARAMETERS CAN BE OF FOUR TYPES:          ÎUMERIC:  THESE PARAMETERS ARE SIMPLY NUMBERS! ÔHEY MAY BE IN THE          RANGE 0-255.  ÎÏÔÅ:  ÅXPRESSIONS SUCH AS '3+4' ARE NOT ALLOWED!!!          ÉNPUT:  THESE PARAMETERS DEFINE SERIES OF CHARACTERS THAT ÄESÔERM          WILL LOOK FOR DURING CERTAIN OPERATIONS.  ÔHE STRING MAY CONTAIN          UP TO 16 CHARACTERS.  ÉF YOU WISH TO MATCH CONTROL CODES (SUCH AS          TAB OR BELL) YOU MUST ENTER THESE IN THE EDITOR USING THE ÃÔÒÌ-Ð          SWITCH.  ÎÏÔÅ: ÉT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MATCH ÃARRIAGE ÒETURN OR          ÌINEFEED.                                          3
