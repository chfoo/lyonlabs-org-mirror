ÏNCE THE INITIALIZATION          IS COMPLETE, THE 80-COLUMN SCREEN WILL DISPLAY THE MAIN TERMINAL          SCREEN AND A WINDOW WITH SOME SHAREWARE INFORMATION IN IT.  Á          TUNE WILL BE PLAYED.  ÙOU MAY EITHER WAIT FOR THE TUNE TO END, OR          JUST SIMPLY HIT A KEY TO ENTER TERMINAL MODE.  ÄESÔERM WILL THEN          SEND AN INITIALIZATION COMMAND TO THE MODEM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT          IS CONFIGURED PROPERLY.  ÍORE INFORMATION ON CONFIGURING ÄESÔERM          AND YOUR MODEM WILL BE GIVEN LATER.  ÏNCE THIS COMMAND IS SENT, A          CHECK IS MADE TO SEE IF A FILE CALLED 'DSL.STARTUP' EXISTS ON THE          BOOT DISK.  ÔHIS PROGRAM, IF PRESENT, IS A COMMAND FILE THAT CAN          BE USED TO CONFIGURE ÄESÔERM AT RUN TIME.  ÏNCE THE STARTUP FILE          HAS FINISHED ITS WORK (IF ANY), THE MAIN TERMINAL MODE IS          ENTERED, AND THE TERMINAL IS READY TO USE.                                          2          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990                ÄESÔERM IS PRINCIPALLY A MENU-DRIVEN PROGRAM AND TO GET THE          MAIN MENU ONSCREEN, YOU SIMPLY PRESS ÃÔÒÌ/ÒÕÎÓÔÏÐ.  ÔHIS IS THE          MOST IMPORTANT KEY-SEQUENCE IN ÄESÔERM, SINCE FROM THIS SEQUENCE,          ÁÌÌ FEATURES OF ÄESÔERM MAY BE ACCESSED.                     ÎÏÔÅ: ÔHE ÃÔÒÌ AND ÒÕÎÓÔÏÐ KEYS WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY          RARELY USED TOGETHER, AND AS SUCH WILL NOT OFTEN BE PRESSED AT          THE SAME TIME BY MISTAKE.  ÅNTERING THE MAIN MENU THIS WAY WILL          ONLY WORK IN THE MAIN TERMINAL MODE WHEN THERE ARE NO OTHER MENUS          PRESENT.               ÔO MOVE AROUND THE MENUS, EITHER SET OF CURSOR KEYS MAY BE          USED.  ÔHE CURRENT SELECTION IS DISPLAYED IN REVERSE.  ÔHE MENUS          WRAP, SO THAT MOVING UP WHEN AT THE TOP OF A MENU WILL JUMP YOU          TO THE BOTTOM AND VICE-VERSA.  ÔO SELECT THE CURRENT OPTION,          SIMPLY PRESS THE EITHER THE ÒÅÔÕÒÎ OR ÅÎÔÅÒ KEY.  ÍANY MENU ITEMS          WILL HAVE ONE LETTER HIGHLIGHTED IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR -- THESE          SELECTIONS MAY BE QUICKLY SELECTED BY PRESSING THE APPROPRIATE          LETTER.  ÉF YOU ARE DONE WITH A CERTAIN MENU, YOU MAY EXIT IT BY          PRESSING THE ÅÓÃ KEY, OR BY SELECTING THE MENU OPTION THAT QUITS          (USUALLY THE LAST OPTION, IF PRESENT AT ALL).               ÎOTE, FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO, A JOYSTICK OR MOUSE (1350 &          1351) IN EITHER JOYSTICK PORT WILL MIMIC THE CURSOR KEYS AND          PRESSING THE FIRE/LEFT BUTTON WILL MIMIC THE ÒÅÔÕÒÎ KEY. ÏN A          1351, THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON WILL ACT LIKE PRESSING ÃÔÒÌ/ÒÕÎÓÔÏÐ          WHEN IN TERMINAL MODE, AND LIKE ÅÓÃ WHEN A MENU IS PRESENT.  ÔHE          MOUSE/JOYSTICK PORT MAY BE SELECTED BY THE USER AND THE BEHAVIOR          OF THE MOUSE WHEN NOT IN MENUS CAN BE CHOSEN -- SEE THE ÕSER          SETUP SECTION.  ÓOMETIMES IT IS NECESSARY TO ENTER TEXT INTO A          WINDOW (SUCH AS A FILENAME OR TELEPHONE NUMBER).  ÉT IS POSSIBLE          TO USE THE CURSOR KEYS WHILE TYPING TO MOVE THE CURSOR BACK AND          FORTH TO EDIT THE ENTRY.  ÕSING THE MENUS TO CONFIGURE ÄESÔERM IS          VERY EASY TO DO, BUT CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE LONG-WINDED. ÔO          SAVE TIME, ÈÏÔËÅÙ COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED.  ÁLL OF THE          ALPHABETIC KEYS, WHEN PRESSED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ÁÌÔ KEY          (ÁÌÔ), WILL PERFORM SOME ACTION OR BRING UP A MENU. ÆOR A          COMPLETE LIST, PRESS THE ÈÅÌÐ KEY WHILE IN TERMINAL MODE.  ÉN          MOST TERMINAL MODES, THE ÃOMMODORE KEY (Ã=) MAY BE USED IN PLACE          OF THE ÁÌÔ KEY; THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS THE ÃOMMODORE EMULATION          MODE IN WHICH CASE Ã= IS USED AS IF ON A NORMAL ÃOMMODORE          KEYBOARD.  ÙOU NOW KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND ÄESÔERM AND, IN THE          NEXT SECTION, YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO CONFIGURE ÄESÔERM TO WORK          BEST WITH YOUR HARDWARE.                                          3          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          2.1  ÃONFIGURING ÄESÔERM FOR YOUR ÈARDWARE          ------------------------------------------                ÔHE MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF COMPUTING IS THE TIME WASTED          WHEN A PROGRAM IS NOT CONFIGURED CORRECTLY TO WORK WITH          PERIPHERALS.  ×ITH TELECOMMUNICATIONS THIS PROBLEM IS          PARTICULARLY BAD, SINCE EVERY MODEM WORKS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT          WAY AND SOMETIMES THE TECHNICAL JARGON CAN OVERWHELM TECHNICALLY          INEXPERIENCED USERS.  ÔO USE ÄESÔERM 128 TO ITS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL          YOU MUST HAVE A ÈAYES COMPATIBLE MODEM (WITH INTERFACE), A          ÃOMMODORE 1670, 1650 OR 1660 MODEM.  ÉF YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE OF          THESE TYPES OF MODEMS, YOU MAY STILL BE ABLE TO USE ÄESÔERM, BUT          YOU WILL AT LEAST BE UNABLE TO MAKE USE OF THE AUTODIALING          FEATURES.  ÔHE PROBLEMS OF CONNECTING AN ÒÓ-232 BASED MODEM TO          THE Ã128 IS EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THE Ã128'S MODEM PORT DOES NOT          CONNECT TO A 'STANDARD' ÒÓ-232 CONNECTOR AND THE VOLTAGES OF THE          SIGNALS AT THE Ã128 ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE MODEM EXPECTS.  ÍANY          COMPANIES HAVE MADE INTERFACES BUT, ALAS, SOME INVERT THE          POLARITY OF THE MODEM CONTROL SIGNALS, SOME LEAVE THEM ALONE AND          SOME DON'T EVEN SUPPORT THEM.  ÄESÔERM REQUIRES TWO OF THESE          SIGNALS FOR PROPER OPERATION: ÄATA ÃARRIER ÄETECT (ÄÃÄ) AND ÄATA          ÔERMINAL ÒEADY (ÄÔÒ).  ÔHE FIRST STEP IN SETTING UP ÄESÔERM IS TO          DISCOVER IF THE INTERFACE SIGNALS NEED TO BE INVERTED OR NOT...          2.1.1 ÍODEM ÃONFIGURATION          -------------------------              ÆOR REASONS UNKNOWN TO ANYONE BUT THE DESIGNERS AT MAJOR          MODEM MANUFACTURERS, MOST MODEMS ARE SHIPPED WITH A DEFAULT          CONFIGURATION THAT IS NOT IDEAL FOR ANY APPLICATION KNOWN TO ÍAN.          ÔHE FEATURES OF MODEMS (AND THEREFORE THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATIONS)          VARY WIDELY FROM MODEL TO MODEL, BUT THERE ARE A FEW COMMON          PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BEFORE WE GET INTO THE          CONFIGURATION OF ÄESÔERM. ÍOST MODEMS COME WITH A SET OF SWITCHES          (USUALLY REFERRED TO AS "ÄÉÐ SWITCHES") THAT CONTROL SOME BASIC          FUNCTIONS. ÙOUR MODEM'S MANUAL SHOULD TELL YOU WHERE TO FIND          THESE SWITCHES OR, IF YOUR MODEM DOESN'T HAVE ANY SWITCHES, HOW          TO PROGRAM THE MODEM'S CONFIGURATION TO GET THE SAME EFFECT.          ÒEMEMBER: CONFIGURATION COMMANDS TYPED AT THE MODEM DO NOT          NECESSARILY BECOME PERMANENT; SEE YOUR MODEM'S MANUAL FOR          INFORMATION ON MAKING THESE CONFIGURATIONS PERMANENT (MAKING THEM          THE "POWER-UP ÛOR RESETÝ DEFAULT").          ÎÏÔÅ: ÔHE ÄÉÐ SWITCH SETTINGS AND COMMANDS GIVEN HERE ARE MERELY          THE MOST COMMON ONES; YOUR MODEM MAY VARY. ÉF THINGS DON'T LOOK          RIGHT OR DON'T SEEM TO WORK, CONSULT YOUR MODEM'S MANUAL FOR THE          CORRECT WAY TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED SETTING.                                          4          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          ÄÔÒ ÏVERRIDE:            ÄÔÒ IS A SIGNAL THAT THE COMPUTER CAN                                   USE TO CONTROL THE MODEM.

ÔHE MODEM TYPE MAY BE SELECTED IN THE          ÍODEM ÔYPE MENU (IN ÍODEM ÓETTINGS).  ÔHE CHOICES ARE ÎORMAL          ÈAYES, ÉNVERTED ÈAYES, 1670, 1650 AND 1660.

ÉF YOU ARE NOT USING ONE          OF THESE INTERFACES, BUT DO USE A ÈAYES COMPATIBLE MODEM VIA THE          NORMAL STYLE OF ÕSER PORT INTERFACE, YOU'RE IN FOR SOME FUN...               ÁS YOU MAY KNOW, THE ÃOMMODORE 128 DOES NOT HAVE A STANDARD          ÒS-232 COMMUNICATIONS PORT; MODEMS MUST EITHER BE BUILT          SPECIFICALLY FOR IT, OR CONNECTED VIA AN ÒS-232 INTERFACE.  ÔHE          INTERFACES BUILT FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES:  THOSE WHICH INVERT,          AND THOSE THAT DON'T.  ÁLL THIS REALLY MEANS IS THAT THE CONTROL          SIGNALS SENT TO A MODEM WILL BE INVERTED WITH SOME INTERFACES AND          NOT WITH OTHERS.  ÄESÔERM NEEDS TO KNOW WHICH STYLE OF INTERFACE          YOU HAVE SO THAT IT MAY COMMUNICATE WITH IT CORRECTLY.  ÉN ITS          NORMAL STATE, A MODEM WILL FORCE THE ÃARRIER ÄETECT LINE INACTIVE          WHEN IT IS NOT TALKING WITH ANOTHER MODEM, AND ACTIVE WHEN IT IS.           ÄESÔERM MONITORS THE INCOMING ÃARRIER ÄETECT LINE, AND WILL          DISPLAY A CAPITAL Ã JUST BEFORE THE MODEM SPEED ON THE TOP RIGHT          OF THE SCREEN.  ÉF YOUR MODEM IS ON, BUT NOT TALKING TO ANOTHER          MODEM, THERE SHOULD BE NO Ã.  ÉF THERE IS A Ã, TRY SELECTING THE          OTHER ÈAYES OPTION.

ÔHIS IS KNOWN AS ÌÏÃËÉÎÇ THE SPEED.  ÔO DO          THIS EFFECTIVELY, YOU MUST TELL ÄESÔERM TO IGNORE THE CONNECT          RATE.  ÔHIS OPTION DICTATES WHETHER ÄESÔERM WILL CHANGE SPEEDS          WHEN THE MODEM REPORTS A CONNECT.
