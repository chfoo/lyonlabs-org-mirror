          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          2.3.7 ÍODEM ÒESPONSE ÃODES           --------------------------                ÄURING THE DIAL SEQUENCE, ÄESÔERM MAKES USE OF THE REPORT          CODES THAT THE MODEM SENDS.  ÔHESE REPORT CODES TELL ÄESÔERM AT          WHAT SPEED A CONNECT WAS ESTABLISHED, OR THE REASON FOR A          NON-CONNECT.  ÉT IS IMPORTANT FOR ÄESÔERM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS          BEING SENT -- OTHERWISE A CONNECT MAY NEVER BE RECOGNIZED.           ÄESÔERM WILL IGNORE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT UNDERSTOOD, AND WAIT FOR          SOMETHING THAT IT DOES UNDERSTAND.  ÙOU SHOULD MODIFY EACH OF THE          REPORT CODES ("300 ÃONNECT." THROUGH "ÒING.") TO MATCH WHAT YOUR          PARTICULAR MODEM SENDS.  ÉF YOUR MODEM DOES NOT SEND A PARTICULAR          CODE, SIMPLY LEAVE IT ALONE.  ÉF YOU HAVE YOUR MODEM SET TO SEND          NUMERIC CODES, THEN YOU SHOULD CHANGE EACH STRING TO ITS NUMERIC          EQUIVALENT.          2.4 ÒESEND ÉNIT           ---------------                ÉF YOU HAVE CHANGED THE INITIAL STRING, OR FORGOT TO SWITCH          THE MODEM ON BEFORE RUNNING ÄESÔERM, YOU MAY WISH TO RESEND THE          INITIAL STRING.  ÙOU MAY DO THIS BY SELECTING ÒESEND ÉNIT IN THE          ÍODEM ÓETUP MENU.          2.5 ÓETTING THE ÕSER ÅNVIRONMENT           --------------------------------                ÉT IS IMPORTANT TO BE COMFORTABLE WHILE WORKING WITH A          TERMINAL, AND IN THIS SECTION WE WILL DISCUSS HOW TO SET          ÄESÔERM'S OPTIONS TO YOUR PERSONAL LIKING.  ÔHE ÕSER ÅNVIRONMENT          MENU MAY BE FOUND AS THE FIFTH MENU ITEM IN THE MAIN MENU, OR MAY          BE SUMMONED WITH THE ÁÌÔ Õ ÈÏÔËÅÙ SEQUENCE FROM TERMINAL MODE.                                          9          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          2.5.1 ÃHANGING THE ÃOLOURS           --------------------------                ÔHE COLOURS THAT ÄESÔERM USES FOR MENUS, PROMPTS AND TEXT          MAY BE SELECTED WITH THE FIRST SEVEN MENU ITEMS.  ÔHE ÓCREEN          ÃOLOUR IS THE COLOUR THAT IS USED FOR THE BACKGROUND AND BORDER          OF THE 80 COLUMN SCREEN.  ÉN MOST CASES, REMOTE SYSTEMS EXPECT          THIS TO BE BLACK, BUT YOU MAY SET IT TO ANY OF THE 16 COLOURS IF          YOU WISH.  ÔHE ÍENU COLOUR IS THE COLOUR THAT THE MENU OPTIONS          ARE DISPLAYED IN.  ÔHE ÆRAME COLOUR IS THE COLOUR THAT THE FRAME          AROUND MENUS AND WINDOWS ARE DRAWN IN.  ÔHE ÒULER COLOUR IS THE          COLOUR THAT THE ÔÁÂ RULER (SECOND LINE ON SCREEN) IS DRAWN IN.           ÔHE ÐROMPT COLOUR IS THE COLOUR THAT THE PROMPTS ARE DISPLAYED          IN.  ÔHE ÃHAR ÃOLOUR IS THE COLOUR THAT THE TEXT DISPLAYED IN          TERMINAL MODE WILL BE PRINTED IN.  ÉT IS ALSO USED AS THE          CHARACTER COLOUR FOR USER INPUT.  ÔHE LAST COLOUR (ÓTATUS ÃOLOUR)          IS THE COLOUR THAT THE STATUS BAR IS DRAWN IN.  ÙOU MAY CHOOSE          ANY COLOURS THAT YOU WISH, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AS          THE SCREEN COLOUR (OR YOU WON'T SEE ANYTHING!)          ÎÏÔÅ:  ÉF YOU PLAN TO USE ÄESÔERM IN THE PSEUDO 40 COLUMN MODE,          THE SCREEN COLOUR MAY HAVE TO BE BLACK -- SOME ÃOMMODORE 128S FOR          SOME REASON HAVE TROUBLE DISPLAYING THE OTHER COLOURS IF NOT (ÔRY          IT AND SEE!).          2.5.2 ËEY ÃLICK           ---------------                ÄESÔERM CAN MAKE A SMALL 'CLICK' EACH TIME A KEY IS          PRESSED. ÔHIS CAN BE EITHER USEFUL OR ANNOYING (DEPENDING ON YOUR          TASTES OR MOOD), AND THE CLICK MAY BE ENABLED OR DISABLED WITH          THIS OPTION.          2.5.3 ÐRINTER ÄEVICE/ÓEC. ÁDDRESS/ÐRINTER ÔYPE/ÁPPEND ÌINEFEED           --------------------------------------------------------------                ÔHESE THREE MENU ITEMS ALLOW YOU TO SELECT CERTAIN          PARAMETERS THAT PERTAIN DIRECTLY TO YOUR PRINTER.   ÔHE PRINTER          DEVICE WILL NORMALLY BE SET TO 4, BUT FOR MULTI-PRINTER          SITUATIONS, THIS MAY BE ANYTHING FROM 4 TROUGH 7.  ÔHE ÐRINTER          ÓEC ÁDDRESS ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT THE SECONDARY ADDRESS TO USE          WHEN TALKING TO THE PRINTER:  ÎORMALLY THIS WILL BE 7 --- CONSULT          YOUR PRINTER/INTERFACE MANUAL FOR DETAILS.  ÔHE ÐRINTER ÔYPE          SELECTS WHETHER THE PRINTER EXPECTS DATA IN ÃOMMODORE OR TRUE          ÁÓÃÉÉ FORMAT.  ÔHIS SETTING WILL DEPEND ON YOUR PRINTER AND/OR          INTERFACE.                ÓOME PRINTERS WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCE THE PAPER WHEN          THEY RECEIVE A CARRIAGE RETURN (ÃÈÒ$(13)), WHILE OTHERS WILL ONLY          MOVE TO THE LEFT MARGIN (AND THUS NEED LINEFEED CHARACTERS TO                                          10          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          TELL THEM TO ADVANCE THE PAPER).  ÉF YOUR PRINTER REQUIRES LINE          FEEDS, SELECT ÒEQUIRED, ELSE SELECT ÁUTOMATIC.          ÎÏÔÅ: SOME PRINTER INTERFACES AND PRINTERS HAVE A SIMILAR OPTION.          ÍAKE SURE THAT ONLY ONE IS SELECTED TO ADD A LINEFEED, OR YOU MAY          FIND YOUR PAPER ADVANCING SEVERAL LINES FOR EVERY LINE OF TEXT!          2.5.4 ÊOYSTICK/ÍOUSE           --------------------                ÄESÔERM ALLOWS THE USE OF A JOYSTICK, 1350 MOUSE, OR 1351          MOUSE AS SUBSTITUTES FOR THE ÒÅÔÕÒÎ AND CURSOR KEYS. ÔHE 1351          MOUSE (ONLY) ALSO LETS YOU GET IN AND OUT OF MENUS QUICKLY.           ÓINCE A 1350 MOUSE ACTS LIKE A JOYSTICK, ANY MENTION OF JOYSTICKS          IN THIS MANUAL ALSO APPLIES TO THE 1350.                ÔHE BASIC FOUR DIRECTIONS OF THE JOYSTICK/MOUSE ARE          EQUIVALENT TO PRESSING ONE OF THE FOUR CURSOR KEYS.  ÔHIS IS TRUE          WHETHER IN MENU MODE, TERMINAL MODE OR INPUT MODE!  ÔHUS, ÁÎÓÉ          AND ÖÔ102 FULL SCREEN EDITORS WILL WORK JUST BY MOVING THE          JOYSTICK/MOUSE.  ÔHE FIRE/LEFT MOUSE BUTTON WILL ACT AS IF YOU          HAVE PRESSED THE RETURN KEY.  ÉF YOU ARE USING A 1351 MOUSE, THE          RIGHT BUTTON HAS A SPECIAL MEANING. ÐRESSING THIS KEY WHILE IN          TERMINAL MODE IS EQUIVALENT TO PRESSING THE ÃÔÒÌ/ÒÕÎÓÔÏÐ KEYS: IT          CALLS UP THE MAIN MENU.  ÉF YOU PRESS THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON          WHILE IN A MENU, IT HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS PRESSING THE ÅÓÃ KEY:          IT QUITS THE MENU!           ÎÏÔÅ: ON A 1350, THE RIGHT BUTTON HAS ÎÏ EFFECT.          2.5.5 ÍOUSE ÍODE          ----------------               ÄESÔERM CAN BE CONFIGURED TO ALLOW MOUSE/JOYSTICK MOVEMENTS          TO NOT ONLY SELECT CURSOR MOVEMENT DURING MENU SELECTION, BUT          ALSO FOR YOUR NORMAL ÂÂÓ ACTIVITY, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  ÉF YOU          ENJOY USING FULL-SCREEN EDITORS ON YOUR ÁÎÓÉ/ÃOMMODORE GRAPHICS          ÂÂÓ, YOU MAY WANT YOU USE YOUR MOUSE/JOYSTICK TO MOVE AROUND THE          SCREEN EASILY.  ÔHIS IS A GREAT FEATURE, BUT CAN BE FRUSTRATING          IF YOU HAPPEN TO MOVE YOUR MOUSE WHEN YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO (A          TELLTALE SIGN IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF ÛÁ, ÛÂ, ÛÃ OR ÛÄ SEQUENCES          SHOWING UP).  ÔHUS, YOU MAY CONFIGURE ÄESÔERM TO ÏÎÌÙ ALLOW MOUSE          MOVEMENTS IN MENUS, OR IN ALL SITUATIONS.          2.5.6 ÃONTROL ÐORT #          --------------------               ×ITH THIS OPTION, YOU MAY SELECT WHICH CONTROL PORT ÄESÔERM          EXPECTS TO GET MOUSE/JOYSTICK OPERATIONS FROM.  ÃONTROL ÐORT 1 IS          THE PORT CLOSEST TO THE FRONT OF THE KEYBOARD.                                                     11          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          2.5.7 ÉNFORMATION ×INDOWS           -------------------------               ÁT CERTAIN TIMES DURING THE NORMAL OPERATION OF ÄESÔERM, THE          PROGRAM WILL OPEN UP A SMALL WINDOW ON THE SCREEN TO INFORM YOU          OF A CERTAIN EVENT, LIKE THE OPENING OR CLOSING OF A BUFFER.          ÔHERE CAN BE NO TRANSMISSION OF CHARACTERS DURING THE TIME THE          WINDOW IS ONSCREEN (1 SECOND), ALTHOUGH ANY INCOMING CHARACTERS          ARE BUFFERED.  ÏNCE YOU ARE USED TO THE OPERATION OF THE          TERMINAL, YOU MAY WISH TO DISABLE THESE ÉNFORMATION ×INDOWS TO          SAVE TIME.          2.5.8 ÔRANSFER/ÄIAL ÔUNES          -------------------------               ×HEN DOING A LONG UPLOAD OR DOWNLOAD, IT IS CONVENIENT TO          HAVE ÄESÔERM LET YOU KNOW IT HAS FINISHED.  ÔHE STANDARD WAY IS          TO PLAY THE INTRODUCTORY TUNE, BUT YOU MAY WISH TO SELECT THE          TONEBURST OPTION.  ÔHE TONEBURST IS A SERIES OF 4 PARTICULARLY          ANNOYING NOTES CYCLED 10 TIMES -- ENOUGH TO GET YOUR ATTENTION!           ÙOU MAY ALSO WISH TO HAVE UTTER PEACE AND QUIET.  ÔHIS OPTION          ALSO AFFECTS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ÄESÔERM CONNECTS TO A ÂÂÓ.          2.5.9 ÏVERLAYS/ÂUFFER          ---------------------               ÄESÔERM HAS THE ABILITY TO CUT DOWN THE SIZE OF THE BUFFER          IN ORDER TO HAVE SPACE FOR EXTRA PROGRAMS, CALLED "OVERLAYS".  ÉF          YOU WISH TO USE THE OVERLAYS (SUCH AS THE SCRIPT COMPILER -- SEE          THE 'Ä ÓCRIPT ÌANGUAGE ÇUIDE') YOU SHOULD SELECT ÏVERLAYS &          ÂUFFER. IF YOU REQUIRE THE FULL BUFFER, SELECT ÆULL ÂUFFER.  ÔHE          FULL BUFFER SIZE IS 733 80 COLUMN LINES (61Ë), AND THE SMALLER          BUFFER SIZE IS 526 80 COLUMN LINES (42Ë).          2.5.10 ÎÔÓÃ/ÐÁÌ ÍODE          --------------------               ÔHIS OPTION ALLOWS YOU TO TELL ÄESÔERM HOW WHICH VIDEO          SYSTEM YOU ARE USING.  ÔHIS DOES NOT AFFECT ANYTHING VISIBLE, BUT          WILL AFFECT BOTH THE ONLINE TIMER AND DOWNLOAD TIMER.  ÓIMPLY SET          THIS TO WHICHEVER VIDEO SYSTEM YOU USE.  ÔHE ÎÔÓÃ SYSTEM IS USED          IN ÎORTH ÁMERICA, WHILE ÐÁÌ IS USED OVERSEAS.                                          12          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          2.5.11 ÁDJUST ÖÄÃ ÍODE          ----------------------               ÔHIS OPTION ONLY AFFECTS INTERLACE MODE, WHICH IS USED BY          ÄESÔERM TO PROVIDE THE 50,51 AND 52 LINES PER SCREEN (ÓEE ÓCREEN          ÌENGTH).  ÔHERE ARE AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT MODELS OF THE ÖÄÃ          CHIP -- ALL OF WHICH HANDLE INTERLACE MODE TIMING IN SLIGHTLY          DIFFERENT WAYS.  ÉF YOU TRY INTERLACE AND IT LOOKS ÐÁÒÔÉÃÕÌÁÒÌÙ          BAD, YOU MAY WISH TO CHANGE THE ÖÄÃ MODE SETTING.  ÎÏÔÅ:  ÔHE          CHANGE DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL YOU RE-SELECT AN INTERLACED          VIDEO MODE (50, 51 OR 52 LINES).          3 ÉNSTALLING YOUR TELEPHONE DATABASE           ------------------------------------                ÉN THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS WE HAVE DISCUSSED HOW TO GET          ÄESÔERM SET UP FOR YOUR PARTICULAR HARDWARE AND PERSONAL TASTES.           ÙOU ARE NOW READY TO ENTER ALL OF THE TELEPHONE NUMBERS YOU USE          REGULARLY.  ÁT THIS TIME, IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE 16          DIFFERENT NUMBERS IN MEMORY AT ONE TIME, BUT YOU MAY HAVE AS MANY          DIFFERENT SETS ON DISK AS YOU NEED.  ÔOGETHER WITH EACH TELEPHONE          NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION YOU WILL SUPPLY A COMPLETE SET OF          PARAMETERS SUCH THAT, UPON CONNECTING TO THE REMOTE SYSTEM,          ÄESÔERM WILL RECONFIGURE ITSELF TO MATCH THE SYSTEM CONNECTED TO.           ÙOU MAY EVEN INDICATE CHARACTER SET AND FUNCTION KEY FILES TO BE          LOADED AT CONNECT TIME, AS WELL AS A LOGON NAME AND PASSWORD TO          BE USED.  ÂEFORE WE ENTER ALL THE NUMBERS, THERE ARE TWO THINGS          IN THE ÍÏÄÅÍ ÓÅÔÔÉÎÇÓ MENU THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.          3.1  ÄIAL ×AIT/ÄIAL ÐAUSE           -------------------------                ÔHESE ARE THE FIRST TWO OPTIONS IN THE ÍODEM ÓETTINGS MENU,          WHICH IS THE SIXTH ITEM IN THE MAIN MENU.  ÔHE FIRST SETTING,          ÄIAL ×AIT, SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF SECONDS THAT ÄESÔERM WILL WAIT          FOR A CONNECT TO BE MADE.  ÉF A CONNECT IS NOT MADE DURING THIS          TIME, THE CALL IS ABORTED - IF MULTIPLE DIALING, HOWEVER, THE          NEXT NUMBER WILL THEN BE DIALED.  ÔHIS WILL PROBABLY NOT NEED TO          BE MORE THAN 30 SECONDS FOR A LOCAL CALL, BUT FOR LONG DISTANCE          OR INTERNATIONAL CALLS IT SHOULD BE SET LONGER.          ÎÏÔÅ: ÈAYES TYPE MODEMS HAVE A SIMILAR FUNCTION IMPLEMENTED          INTERNALLY (THE Ó7 REGISTER). ÆOR GREATEST ACCURACY, USE THE          MODEM'S Ó7 REGISTER TO SET THE WAIT TIME AND ENTER A LARGER          NUMBER INTO THE ÄESÔERM CONFIGURATION. ×HEN THE MODEM HAS WAITED          THE SPECIFIED TIME AND NO CONNECTION HAS BEEN MADE, IT SHOULD          REPORT "ÎÏ ÃÏÎÎÅÃÔ" OR "ÎÏ ÃÁÒÒÉÅÒ", AND ÄESÔERM WILL RECOGNIZE          THIS AS THE INDICATION THAT THE CALL FAILED.  ÔHE DELAY SHOULD BE          PROGRAMMED INTO THE Ó7 REGISTER EITHER WHEN ÄESÔERM IS RUN (USING          THE ÉNITIAL ÓEQUENCE) OR WHEN THE DIAL COMMAND IS SENT (USING THE                                          13          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          ÄIAL ÐREFIX).                ÔHE SECOND SETTING, ÄIAL ÐAUSE, SPECIFIES THE AMOUNT OF          TIME THAT ÄESÔERM WILL WAIT BETWEEN CALLS.  ÔHE MINIMUM TIME          DELAY THAT WILL WORK IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH YOUR MODEM AND THE          PHONE COMPANY'S EQUIPMENT.  ÉF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PHONE STILL          REPORTS "ÂÕÓÙ" OR "ÎÏ ÄÉÁÌ ÔÏÎÅ" AT THE START OF A RE-DIAL, THEN          YOU SHOULD INCREASE THIS VALUE.  Á SETTING OF TWO SECONDS WORKS          IN MOST CASES.          3.2 ÅNTERING THE ÔELEPHONE ÄATABASE           -----------------------------------                ÔHE ÔELEPHONE ÄATABASE IS EDITED BY SELECTING THE ÅDIT          ÎUMBER ÆILE OPTION IN THE MAIN MENU, OR YOU MAY SIMPLY PRESS ÁÌÔ          Î FROM TERMINAL MODE.  ÔHE PHONE DIRECTORY CONTAINS ROOM FOR 16          ENTRIES -- SIMPLY SELECT THE ONE YOU WISH TO EDIT AS IF IT WERE A          MENU OPTION.  ÙOU WILL SEE A NEW MENU COME UP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO          SPECIFY MANY PARAMETERS THAT ARE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT          PARTICULAR ENTRY.  ÔO EDIT A PARTICULAR PARAMETER, SIMPLY SELECT          IT IN THE NORMAL MANNER.                ÔHE ÃOMMENT MAY BE UP TO 32 CHARACTERS LONG, AND SERVES TO          REMIND YOU ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ENTRY. ÉT WAS DESIGNED TO HOLD          THE NAME OF THE SYSTEM IN QUESTION, BUT WHAT YOU PUT IN IT IS UP          TO YOU.  ÔHE ÎUMBER IS UP TO 16 CHARACTERS LONG, AND IS SENT TO          THE MODEM WITHOUT ANY CONVERSIONS -- MAKE SURE THAT WHEN COMBINED          WITH THE DIAL STRING (DEFINED IN SECTION 2.3.7) IT WILL MAKE          SENSE TO THE MODEM.  ÔHE ÂAUD ÒATE SELECTS WHICH SPEED ÄESÔERM          USES WHEN MAKING THE CALL; IN MOST CASES, THIS SHOULD BE SET TO          THE MAXIMUM SPEED YOUR MODEM CAN HANDLE (IE ÍAX.) SO THAT THE          RESULTING CONNECT WILL BE AT THE HIGHEST COMMON SPEED. ÉF, FOR          SOME REASON, YOU WOULD LIKE TO CALL A NUMBER AT SOMETHING LESS          THAN THIS MAXIMUM (E.G. TO OVERCOME LINE NOISE), ENTER A LOWER          SPEED HERE.  ÔHE REST OF THE ITEMS, EXCEPT THE LAST SIX, ARE ALL          DUPLICATES OF ITEMS FOUND IN EITHER THE ÐROTOCOL ÓETTINGS OR          ÅMULATION ÍODE MENUS.  ÆOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH          SETTING, PLEASE REFER TO THE ÐROTOCOL ÓETTINGS AND ÅMULATION ÍODE          SECTIONS.               ÔHE ÃHARACTER ÓET PARAMETER ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT THE          PARTICULAR CHARACTER SET YOU WISH TO USE WITH EACH NUMBER.  ÆOR A          DESCRIPTION OF THE FORMAT OF CHARACTER SETS, REFER TO THE          ÁPPENDICES.  ÉF NO CHARACTER SET IS SPECIFIED OR THE SPECIFIED          SET DOES NOT EXIST ON THE ÄESÔERM ÆILES ÄEVICE (ÓECTION [[]]),          THEN THE CURRENTLY LOADED CHARACTER SET WILL BE USED.  ÔHE          ÆUNCTION ÆILE SPECIFIES THE SET OF FUNCTION KEYS THAT WILL BE          USED WITH EACH NUMBER.  ÔHE SAME LOADING CONDITIONS APPLY AS FOR          THE CHARACTER SET FILE.  ÔHE CREATION OF FUNCTION KEY FILES WILL          BE DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT SECTION.  ÔHE ÌOGON ÎAME AND ÐASSWORD          OPTIONS ALLOW YOU TO SPECIFY WHICH NAME AND PASSWORD SHOULD BE                                          14          ÄESÔERM 128 Ö2.00                                       ÊUNE 1990          USED FOR AN AUTOMATIC LOGON PROCESS.  ÎÏÔÅ:  ÔHESE WILL NORMALLY          NEED TRAILING CARRIAGE RETURNS, DEPENDING ON THE SCRIPT.  ÓCRIPT          ÆILE SELECTS WHICH SCRIPT FILE SHOULD BE USED TO LOGON. ÆOR MORE          ABOUT SCRIPT FILES, READ THE ÄÅÓÔÅÒÍ ÓÃÒÉÐÔÉÎÇ ÌÁÎÇÕÁÇÅ ÍÁÎÕÁÌ.                ÏNCE YOU HAVE ENTERED ALL OF YOUR NUMBERS, OR FILLED UP THE          DIRECTORY YOU MAY SAVE IT BY SELECTING THE ÓAVE ÔELEPHONE ÆILE          OPTION. ÙOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR A FILENAME (THE DEFAULT NAME IS          ÄÅÓ.ÔÅÌÅÐÈÏÎÅ).  ÉF YOU ONLY NEED ONE TELEPHONE FILE, THEN YOU          MAY JUST PRESS RETURN TO USE THE DEFAULT.  ÉF YOU NEED MULTIPLE          TELEPHONE FILES, THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO EDIT THE NAME TO MAKE IT          UNIQUE.  ÉF THE FILE ALREADY EXISTS, YOU ARE ASKED IF YOU WANT TO          REPLACE IT -- IF SO, THE FILE IS REPLACED, OTHERWISE THE SAVE IS          ABORTED.  ÉF YOU NEED ANOTHER TELEPHONE FILE, SIMPLY EDIT THE OLD          DEFINITIONS AND SAVE THE DIRECTORY AGAIN WITH A NEW NAME.           ÉNFORMATION ON HOW TO ACCESS MULTIPLE TELEPHONE FILES IS GIVEN IN          THE SECTION 15.1.          4 ÄEFINING ÆUNCTION ËEYS           ------------------------                ÄESÔERM ALLOWS YOU TO DEFINE UP TO EIGHT FUNCTION KEYS,          WITH EACH ONE CONTAINING UP TO 32 CHARACTERS.  ÙOU MAY DEFINE AS          MANY SETS OF KEYS AS YOU WISH, SAVING EACH SET ON DISK TO BE          RECALLED WHENEVER YOU NEED IT.  ÔO ENTER FUNCTION KEY          DEFINITIONS, SELECT THE ÄEFINE ÆUNCTIONS OPTION IN THE MAIN MENU,          OR PRESS ÁÌÔ Æ FROM TERMINAL MODE.  ÔO CHANGE A DEFINITION,          SIMPLY SELECT THE OPTION CORRESPONDING TO THE FUNCTION KEY YOU          WISH TO EDIT.  ÙOU MAY INCLUDE CONTROL AND ESCAPE SEQUENCES IN          THE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS IN THE SAME WAY AS FOR THE ÉNITIAL          ÓEQUENCE.  ÔO SAVE THE FUNCTION KEY DEFINITIONS, SIMPLY CHOOSE          ÓAVE ÆUNCTIONS.  ÉF YOU ONLY WANT ONE SET OF FUNCTION KEYS, YOU          MAY SELECT THE DEFAULT NAME (ÄÅÓ.ÆÕÎÃÔÉÏÎÓ) BY PRESSING RETURN.           ÉF YOU WILL BE USING SEVERAL SETS OF FUNCTION KEYS, THEN GIVE          EACH SET A UNIQUE NAME.  ÉF THE FUNCTION KEY FILE IS TO BE          ASSOCIATED WITH AN ENTRY IN THE TELEPHONE DIRECTORY, BE SURE THE          NAMES MATCH!
