Notes about unarcing DesTerm V2.00
----------------------------------

The DesTerm 128 V2.00 release package consists of five files:

DES200_1.SFX
DES200_2.SFX
DES200_3.SFX
DES200_4.SFX
DESNOTES.TXT

If you do not have all of these files, you do not have the complete 
distribution package.  If this is so, you should find out who uploaded the
files you do have and ask them to add the rest!

To extract the files, simply load each one into memory (128 mode is best)
and type RUN.  If you have a 1541 disk drive, you will need two disks --
extract DES200_1.SFX and DES200_2.SFX to the first disk, and the other files
to the second.  1581 and 1571 users need only 1 disk, and all the .SFX files
can be extracted in order.

For some reason unknown to me, the file 'FILETYPE CHANGER' in DES200_2.SFX
reports a CRC ERROR when extracting.  The file is perfectly ok and this
should not be a cause for alarm.  If any other files are reported with
errors, then there is a problem.

After all the files o BBSes as long as the following
conditions are met:

1)  Do not upload any of these files to any of the large PAY services (ie
    GENIE, COMPUSERVE, QLINK, BIX etc).  I (or a designated person) will
    upload to these systems.

2)  All of the fio BBSes as long as the following
conditions are met:

1)  Do not upload any of these files to any of the large PAY services (ie
    GENIE, COMPUSERVE, QLINK, BIX etc).  I (or a designated person) will
    upload to these systems.

2)  All of the five files MUST be uploaded.  The five files must be in the same 
    directory, and some indication made that all 5 need to be fetched.

3)  The files must be uploaded in the original format.  DO NOT re-archive
    the contents.  The .SFX format works well as any -- don't play with it!
