ÔHIS APPROACH IS ALL VERY WELL FOR ÂÁÓÉÃ, BUT IS UNWIELDY          FOR APPLICATION PROGRAMS.  ÄESÔERM USES THE DRIVE LETTER APPROACH          TO DRIVE ACCESS.  ÉN THIS SYSTEM, EACH PHYSICAL DISK DEVICE IS          ASSIGNED A LETTER IN THE RANGE Á TO Ç.  ÉN ORDER TO SPECIFY ANY          GIVEN DRIVE, SIMPLY USE THE LETTER THAT IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH.           ÔHUS, IF DRIVE DEVICE 9 IS ASSIGNED THE LETTER Â, AND YOU WISH TO          LOAD A FILE FROM IT, THE FILENAME WOULD BE Â:FILE.          ÄESÔERM SUPPORTS 7 USER DEFINABLE-DRIVE LETTERS (Á: THROUGH Ç:),          AND Í: WHICH IS THE RAMDISK. ×HENEVER YOU HAVE TO TYPE A          FILENAME, YOU MAY SPECIFY A DRIVE LETTER IN FRONT OF IT AND THAT          DRIVE WILL BE USED.  ÉF YOU DO NOT SPECIFY A DRIVE, THE DEFAULT          DRIVE WILL BE USED.  ÄEPENDING ON THE SITUATION, THERE ARE TWO          DEFAULT DRIVES:  ÕSER ÄEVICE AND ÄESÔERM ÄEVICE. ÔHE USER DEVICE          IS USED FOR UPLOADS, DOWNLOADS. LOADS AND SAVES.  ÔHE ÄESÔERM          DEVICE IS USED FOR LOADING CHARACTER SETS, FUNCTION KEYS, SCRIPTS          AND OVERLAYS.  ÔHESE DEVICES ARE FULLY CONFIGURABLE, AND ADD          TREMENDOUSLY TO THE EASE OF USE.          9.3 ÒAMDISK ÏPERATION          ---------------------               ÄESÔERM COMES COMPLETE WITH VERY FAST RAMDISK SOFTWARE THAT          USES YOUR 1700, 1750 OR 1764 ÒAM AS A LARGE DISK.

ÐATTERN MATCHING IS A GOOD WAY TO SELECT MULTIPLE FILES          FOR DELETION, COPYING OR UPLOADING, BUT SOMETIMES THERE ARE NO          SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE FILENAMES YOU WISH TO MANIPULATE.

ÙOU CAN          THEN SCRATCH, COPY OR UPLOAD (USING ÙMODEM OR ONE OF THE MULTIPLE          ÐUNTER PROTOCOLS) MULTIPLE FILES EASILY.  ÙOU USE THIS OPTION          (AND THE SIMILAR ONE IN THE ÔRANSFER ÏPTIONS MENU) TO DECIDE          WHETHER FILENAMES COME FROM THE BUFFER (LIST) OR FROM NORMAL FILE          PATTERNS (PATTERN).  ÙOU USE THE NORMAL SCRATCH, COPY AND UPLOAD          OPTIONS, AND LET ÄESÔERM SORT OUT THE APPROPRIATE NAMES.               ÉN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FILENAMES TO SEND, SELECT 'ÄIR >          ÂUFFER', WHICH WILL PUT A COPY OF THE DIRECTORY IN THE BUFFER.          ÙOU MAY THEN EDIT THE BUFFER TO REMOVE THE NAMES OF ANY FILES YOU          DON'T WISH TO COPY/SCRATCH/UPLOAD.  ÏNLY LINES THAT BEGIN WITH A          LETTER (Á - Ç OR Í) AND HAVE A ':' IN THE SECOND CHARACTER ARE          TREATED AS FILENAMES (AND THEN ONLY IF THE FILE EXISTS!), SO          THERE IS NO NEED TO DELETE OLD TEXT, OR TO GET RID OF THE HEADER          LINE.  ÎÏÔÅ:  ÉF YOU WISH TO ADD YOUR OWN NAMES, THIS WILL WORK,          BUT BE SURE TO ENTER IT IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE OTHERS (DRIVE,          COLON, NAME, SPACES AND FILETYPE).  ÉT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO ADD          ENOUGH SPACES TO MAKE THE FILETYPE LINE UP.               ÎOW THAT YOU HAVE A LIST OF NAMES, YOU CAN SELECT 'ÌIST' IN          THE ÆILE ÍATCH MENU, AND SCRATCH, COPY OR UPLOAD FILES IN THE          LIST.          10 ÄIALING ÎUMBERS           ------------------                ÄESÔERM OFFERS FOUR WAYS TO DIAL NUMBERS.

ÄURING THE DIAL,          PRESSING ÅÓÃ WILL ABORT THE WHOLE DIAL -- MULTIPLE DIALS WILL          CEASE COMPLETELY.  ÐRESSING SPACE WILL ABORT THE CURRENT DIAL AND          PROCEED WITH THE NEXT (IF THERE IS ONE).  ÔHE TIME WILL COUNT          DOWN, AND THE CURRENT DIAL WILL BE ABORTED IF IT REACHES 0 (ÔHIS          TIME IS THE ÄIAL ×AIT, WHICH IS SET IN THE ÍODEM ÓETUP MENU).               ÔHE ÓTATUS LINE IS USEFUL FOR CERTAIN MODEMS.
