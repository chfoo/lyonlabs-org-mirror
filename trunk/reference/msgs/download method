”’¬ : DOWNLOADING METHOD         (“3)  ∆“œÕ: ÕR ÕOOR     10/12/94   ”#: 74815   WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD, PLEASE SAVE ALL THE DESCRIPTIONS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. I AM GOING TO CREATE A PROGRAM TO STRIP ALL THE FILE INFORMATION FROM THE DESCRIPTIONS. (FILE,FROM,DATE,S#,SUBJ,TYPE,BLKS) AND STORE IT IN A DATABASE FILE FOR EASY SORTING, SEARCHING ETC. BUT I CANT DO IT WITHOUT THE FILES. TO MAKE IT EASIER ON MY HANDS I HAVE CREATED A EASY FILE NAMING METHOD. YOU TAKE THE 1ST CHARACTER FROM THE FILENAME AND THEN YOU ADD A NUMBER TO THE END OF IT, EXAMPLE: DESCRIPTION FILENAME:  232 DOWNLOAD FILENAME   :  œ»ŒŒŸ¬«œœƒ≈.Õ’”THIS WAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIRECTORY YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DESCRIPTION APPEARS TO GO WITH THE FILENAME. THIS IS GOOD FOR CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU MISSED ANY FILES OR DESCRIPTIONS DURING DOWNLOADS WHEN YOU CHECK THE DIRECTORY. ALSO TO AVOID THE SAME PROBLEM IF YOU ENCOUNTER A 'FILE NOT FOUND' I ALWAYS RE-SAVE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MISSING FILE AS:∆Œ∆ 105, ∆Œ∆ 106, ETC.I USE SEPARATE NUMBERS FOR ∆Œ∆'S THAN I DO FOR THE DESCRIPTIONS TO KEEP A RUNNING TALLY OF THEM. ALSO USING THE ABOVE METHOD YOU CAN KEEP TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL DOWNLOADS YOU MADE. I JUST WRITE DOWN A COLUMN OF NUMBERS IN MY SPIRAL STENO NOTEBOOK AND THEN I JUST FILL IN THE 1ST CHARACTER OF THE FILENAME. I KEEP THE FILENAME AND THE ∆Œ∆ NUMBER I ASSIGNED TO IT IN A SPEARATE SECTION OF THE NOTEBOOK FOR ALL 'FILE NOT FOUNDS'. ON THE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN YOU HAVE 2 FILES WITH THE SAME NAME AND YOU HAVE THE DESCRIPTION ALREADY SAVED I JUST RE-SAVE THE DESCRIPTION AS "DEL ????" SO I KNOW THE FILE IS STORED ON THE OTHER DISK OR PARTITION AND THAT THE PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION CAN BE DELETED. IF YOU HAVE A 2ND DESCRIPTION SAVED UNDER "∆Œ∆" I CAN LATER COPY "∆Œ∆*" OFF THE DISKS AND CONVERT THESE DESCRIPTIONS TO A SEPARATE DATABASE FILE SO WE HAVE A LIST OF THE MISSING FILES. THIS IS MY METHOD, IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST, BUT IT WORKS FOR ME. IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD, MAKE SURE YOU POST WHAT SECTION YOU ARE DOWNLOADING SO SOMEONE ELSE DOESNT DO THE SAME AREAÕR ÕOOR                     -::-”’¬ : ALSO                       (“)   ∆“œÕ: ÕR ÕOOR     10/12/94   ”#: 74831   WHEN SAVING DESCRIPTIONS, ALSO GRAB THE COMMENTS (REPLYS). IF YOU USE SAME FILENAME AS YOU DID FOR THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION, IT WILL APPEND THE REPLY TO THE END OF THE DESCRIPTION. SO WHEN YOU GO BACK AND READ IT, THE DESCRIPTION AND THE REPLYS ARE ALL IN ONE FILE.                     -::-”’¬ : .
