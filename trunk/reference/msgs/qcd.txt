I think a lot of the blame for this has to be Commodore's. They abandoned a great computer-The C-128. Even today, they could sell millions of these. IBM is very expensive and way too much power for what most people want to do with a home computer. The C-64 and 128 would still be an attractive option.A foolish business decision!!

we finally are using a PC (IBM) where I work and my experience with my 8 bit has put me at the top of the list.  Everyone else is looking at the keyboard in horror! ;)
