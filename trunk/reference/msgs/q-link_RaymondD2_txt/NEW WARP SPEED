×ÁÒÐ ÓÐÅÅÄÃINEMAWAREÐRICE - $29.95ÒATING - *** 1/2ÃOMMODORE 64/128ÆAST LOADING CARTRIDGES ARENOTHING NEW FOR THE ÃOMMODORE; INFACT, CONSIDERING HOW MANY DIFFERENTVERSIONS ARE AVAILABLE, IT WOULD SEEMTHAT THE LAST THING WE NEED ISANOTHER ENTRY IN THE FAST LOADINGDERBY. É HAVE, HOWEVER, FOUND ROOM ON MYCOMPUTER TABLE FOR ×ARP ÓPEED FROMÃINEMAWARE. ×HILE É HAVE ACCUMULATEDA WIDE VARIETY OF FAST LOADINGDEVICES, SOME HARDWARE, SOMESOFTWARE, OVER THE YEARS, THIS IS THEFIRST CARTRIDGE É'VE ENCOUNTERED THATWORKS WITH THE 1541, 1571, 1581 DISKDRIVES FROM ÃOMMODORE, AND ALSO WORKSWITH MY ÍÓÄ DUAL DRIVE.ÁS WITH ALL DISK DRIVEACCELERATORS, COMPATIBILITY WILL VARYDEPENDING ON WHAT SOFTWARE YOU USE.É HAVEN'T BEEN VERY METHODICAL IN MYTESTING OF ×ARP ÓPEED, BUT IT SEEMSTO BEHAVE VERY REASONABLY. ÁSEXPECTED, THE MORE ESOTERIC THESOFTWARE PROTECTION INVOLVED, THELOWER GREATER THE ODDS OFINCOMPATIBILITY. É DID DISCOVER ONEOF MY FAVORITE GAMES (ÌANCE ÈAFFNER'SÆULL ÃOUNT ÂASEBALL) THAT DIDN'T HAVEENOUGH MEMORY LEFT TO RUN WITH THECARTRIDGE IN PLACE.ÉF YOU'RE USING AN ÍÓÄ DRIVE, THISCARTRIDGE IS WELL WORTH CHECKING OUT.É'M NOT AWARE OF AN ALTERNATIVEDEVICE THAT SUPPORTS THE FULLGAUNTLET OF DISK DRIVES FOR THEÃOMMODORE.           <ÐÒÅÓÓ Æ5 ÆÏÒ ÍÅÎÕ>
