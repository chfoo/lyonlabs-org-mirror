ŸOU CAN USE THE ’‘Ã COMMAND TO SPECIFY HOW MANY "JIFFIES" A NOTE SHOULD PLAY.  ¡ JIFFY LASTS ABOUT 1/60 OF A SECOND; THE FASTER THE TEMPO, THE SHORTER THE JIFFY.  ‘HE TEMPO RESTRICTIONS CHART WILL DISPLAY THE JIFFY DURATION FOR EACH NOTE IN EACH TEMPO.   IFFY DURATIONS THAT ARE NOT DISPLAYED MEANS THAT THOSE NOTES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THAT TEMPO VALUE.  …F YOU ARE USING A TEMPO VALUE OF 138, AND THE NEXT HIGHER OR LOWER TEMPO SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR SONG ¬’‘ YOUR SID CONTAINS SIXTEENTH NOTES <WHICH ARE NOT ALLOWED AT TEMPO 138>, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO:  A SIXTEENTH NOTE IS ONE HALF OF AN EIGHTH NOTE, SO CHECK PLAYED AT TEMPO 138.  …N THIS CASE, THE IT'S NOT EQUALLY DIVISIBLE, SO YOU GET AN ANSWER OF 7 AND 6.  ”O, SET THE ’‘Ã COMMAND TO 7 <AT THE COMMAND SCREEN>, GO TO THE EDITING SCREEN AND PRESS THE "U" KEY.  …NSTEAD OF A NOTE, YOU'LL SEE "UTILITY" DISPLAYED IN THE BOX.  ◊ITH YOUR JOYSTICK OR KEYBOARD, PUT THE NOTE WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE STAFF AND HIT RETURN <OR PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON ON THE JOYSTICK>, AND A "U" WITH THE PITCH AND OCTAVE WILL BE ENTERED.  …F ANOTHER SIXTEENTH NOTE IS TO BE PLAYED IN THE SAME MEASURE, ITS ’‘Ã VALUE WOULD BE 6 <7+6=13>.  …F NO OTHER SIXTEENTH NOTE IS PLAYED, THEN A ’‘Ã REST OF 6 SHOULD BE ENTERED.  “EMEMBER, YOU MUST KEEP THE TOTAL JIFFIES IN A MEASURE CONSISTANT WITH ALL OTHER MEASURES.  ‘HE ’‘Ã COMMAND IS ALSO USED TO ENTER "TRIPLETS".  ¡ SIXTEENTH TRIPLET MEANS THAT THREE NOTES SHOULD BE PLAYED IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME AS ONE EIGTH NOTE. ‘O DO THIS, AGAIN CHECK THE JIFFY DURATION OF AN EIGHTH NOTE FOR THE PARTICULAR TEMPO YOU'RE USING.  ¡S AN EXAMPLE, WE'LL USE ‘≈Õ 100, IN WHICH AN EIGHTH NOTE PLAYS FOR 12 JIFFIES. ƒIVIDE 3 <THE NUMBER OF NOTES TO BE PLAYED> INTO 12; THE ANSWER IS 4, SO EACH NOTE IN THE SIXTEENTH TRIPLET SHOULD PLAY FOR 4 JIFFIES.  ”ET THE ’‘Ã COMMAND AT 4 AND ENTER THE NOTES AS EARLIER DESCRIBED.  …N SOME CASES, THOUGH, YOU'LL NOT GET AN EQUAL NUMBER -- FOR INSTANCE, AT FIRST NOTE OF THE TRIPLET, SET THE ’‘Ã COMMAND AT 2; THEN FOR THE SECOND NOTE AND THIRD NOTE OF THE TRIPLET, THE ’‘Ã COMMAND WOULD BE 3.  ‘HE SET ’‘Ã VALUE REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL CHANGED.  ¬EWARE:  IF YOU'RE USING ’‘Ã COMMAND OF ’‘Ã ON ONE VOICE MAY AFFECT THE NOTES ON ANOTHER.  ”O TRY TO ALWAYS USE THE SAME ’‘Ã SETTING ON EACH VOICE.  œN SHEET MUSIC, IF YOU SEE A NOTE THAT IS SMALLER AND WRITTEN BEFORE ANOTHER NOTE, THIS IS CALLED A "GRACE NOTE". ¡ GRACE NOTE IS PLAYED QUICKLY, JUST LONG ENOUGH TO BE HEARD.  ’SE THE ’‘Ã COMMAND TO ENTER GRACE NOTES.  ‘HERE IS JUDGEMENT.  »OWEVER, REMEMBER THAT MOST MUST BORROW FROM THE –“≈√≈≈ƒ…Œ« NOTE FOR THE GRACE NOTE.  ≈XAMPLE: USING ‘≈Õ 100, ENTER A QUARTER NOTE FOLLOWED BY A GRACED QUARTER NOTE.  ¡T ‘≈Õ 100, A QUARTER NOTE LASTS FOR 24 JIFFIES, AND WE WANT THE GRACE NOTE TO BE 4 JIFFIES LONG.  ≈NTER THE FIRST QUARTER NOTE, USING THE ’‘Ã VALUE OF 20.  ‘HEN ENTER THE GRACE NOTE WITH A ’‘Ã VALUE OF 4, THEN ENTER THE LAST QUARTER NOTE AS USUAL.  ¡S DISCUSSED EARLIER, A DOT PLACED AFTER A NOTE MEANS THAT THE NOTE DURATION SHOULD BE INCREASED BY ONE HALF.  ”OMETIMES YOU MIGHT SEE A NOTE FOLLOWED BY ‘◊œ DOTS.  ‘HIS IS A DOUBLE EXTENDED THE SAME AMOUNT AS A DOTTED NOTE –Ã’” HALF THE VALUE OF THE FIRST DOT.  ≈XAMPLE:  A DOUBLE DOTTED HALF NOTE WOULD BE EQUAL TO A HALF NOTE, A QUARTER NOTE AND AN EIGHTH NOTE -- TIED TOGETHER.  ‘HE ≈NHANCED ≈DITOR SUPPORTS DOUBLE DOTTED NOTES; HOWEVER, THIS IS AN "ENHANCED" COMMAND NOT SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC DOMAIN PLAYERS. …F YOU DO NOT WISH TO USE THIS COMMAND, THE DOUBLE DOTTED NOTE DURATION.  ¡NOTHER "ENHANCED" COMMAND NOT SUPPORTED BY CURRENT PUBLIC DOMAIN PLAYERS IS THE DOUBLE SHARP OR DOUBLE FLAT COMMAND.  …F YOU DO NOT WISH TO USE THE COMMAND, YOU MUST CALCULATE THE PITCH THAT SHOULD BE ENTERED. ∆OR INSTANCE, IF YOU ENCOUNTER A √-DOUBLE-SHARP, YOU SHOULD ENTER A ƒ-NATURAL.  ¬Y NOW, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER AN ENTIRE SONG WITH LITTLE DIFFICULTY. –LEASE, IF YOU UPLOAD ANY OF YOUR WORK, SURE … INCLUDE THEM IN MY LIBRARY.  ŒEXT WEEK, WE'LL COVER MORE ADVANCED MUSIC THEORY AND ENVELOPES, INCLUDING PULSE SWEEP AND PORTAMENTO, AND FILTER SETTINGS.  :)
