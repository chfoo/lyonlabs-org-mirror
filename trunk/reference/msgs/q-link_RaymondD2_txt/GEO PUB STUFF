ÓÕÂÊ: ÇÅÏÓ ÐUBLISH 128 ALREADY AV(Ò4)  ÆÒÏÍ: ÍESSMER     06/25/88   Ó#: 831762  ÙOU CAN RUN ÇÅÏ ÐUB 128 UNDER ÇÅÏ 128 IF YOU USE ÇÅÏÓ ÂUSTERS TO BREAK THE ÂÓ× PROTECTION ON BOTH.  ÂÓ× IN THEIR INFINITE WISDOM PUT A DELAY TRAP IN ÇÅÏÓ128.  ×HEN YOU ORIGINALLY INSTALL ÇÅÏÓ128 IT ASKS IF YOU HAVE ANY APPLICATIONS,  ×ELL OF COURSE YOU DON'T YOU JUST BOUGHT IT.  ÉF YOU ANSWER NO (THE TRUTH) YOU CAN'T EVER AGAIN INSTALL AN APPLICATION TO ÇÅÏÓ 128.  É WON'T TRY TO EXPRESS MY OPINION OF THIS PROTECTION SCHEME IT'S ILLEGAL TO TALK LIKE THAT OVER THE PHONE.  É WOULD SAY THAT SINCE THEY THEN KEEP ALMOST EVERY ONE FROM INSTALLING FOLLOW-ON APPLICATIONS THEIR MARKETING STRATEGY COULD USE SOME WORK.  ÏNCE YOU RUN ÇEOSBUSTERS ON BOTH DISKS (BACKUPS ONLY PLEASE) THIS PROTECTION IS DISABLED AND YOU CAN RUN USING BACKUPS INSTEAD OF YOUR ORIGINAL DISKS.  ÔHERE IS A SMALL BUG BY THE WAY.  ÉF YOU BOOT ÇEOÐUB FROM 80 ÃOLS IT CRASHES.  ÂUT IF YOU SWITCH YOURSELF FIRST EVERYTHING IS OK.ÁS FOR GETTING ÇEOSÂUSTERS CHECK THE ADDS IN ÒÕÎ, ÃÇAZZETTE, ETC.  ÔHE ÂIG ADVANTAGE TO RUNNING IN 128 IS THAT YOU CAN USE A 1581 DRIVE.  É HAVE ON ONE 3 1/2 DISK  ÇEOÐUBLISH, ÇEO×RITE, ÇEOÐAINT, ÄESKTOP, 2 ÐUB ÄOCS, 2 ÐHOTO ÁLBUMS, 10 ÐAINT ÄOCS, 20 ÔEXT FILES, 20 ÆONTS, 10 ASSORTED INPUT DRIVERS, PRINT DRIVERS ETC ETC ETC.  ÂELEIVE IT OR NOT I JUST PASSED 50% OF THAT DISK USED.  É MORE THAN ANYONE WOULD LOVE THE EXTRA PROCESSOR SPEED OF AN 80 COL VERSION OF ÇEOÐUBLISH BUT É CAN LIVE WITH THE 40 ÃOL BECAUSE OF THE 1581.ÂY THE WAY ANOTHER SMALL ADVANTAGE IS THAT YOU CAN ACCESS ÐHOTO ÍANAGER FROM ÇEOÐUB DIRECTLY IF YOU ARE IN 128.
