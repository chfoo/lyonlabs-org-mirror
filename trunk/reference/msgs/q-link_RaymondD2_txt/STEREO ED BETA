THE MOST ASKED QUESTION É'VE RECEIVED IS "CAN ALL 6 VOICES SCROLL DURING PLAYBACK?". ÔHE ANSWER IS "NOPE" AND THERE IS NO WAY TO IMPLEMENT THIS.  ×HILE ON THE SUBJECT, WE'D LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THE ÓTEREO ÅDITOR DESIGN IS COMPLETE. ÏNLY TWO MORE OPTIONS WILL BE INCLUDED BEFORE FINAL RELEASE: A SPECIAL .ÍÓ× SAVE AND THE ÍÉÄÉ PLAY. ÔHIS BETA TEST STAGE IS FOR DISCOVERING HIDDEN PROBLEMS WITHIN THE PROGRAM.  ÃURRENTLY, A ÓÉÄ FILE CAN BE 80 BLOCKS TOTAL. ÉF ANY MORE FEATURES ARE ADDED TO THE PROGRAM, IT WILL REDUCE THE SIZE THE COMPLETED ÓÉÄ FILE CAN BE.  ÁLTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE ANY COMMENTS, ÒOBERT REGRETS THAT SUGGESTIONS TO ADD TO OR ALTER THE DESIGN CAN'T BE REALIZED.  ÆINAL RELEASE IS TENTATIVELY SET FOR MID-ÎOVEMBER. ÔHIS ALSO COINCIDES WITH THE NEXT ÓÉÄ ÃLASS SERIES, SO É PLAN TO DEVOTE THE LAST HALF OF THE SERIES TO CREATING STEREO FILES. :)  ÓO KEEP PLUGGING AWAY! ÁND THANKS TO ALL. ÁS ALWAYS, IF YOU NEED HELP, JUST ASK. :)  --ÌAURA--                   -::-ÍAIL ÆROM:  ÌYRICÄATE:  ÔHURSDAY 26-ÏCT-89 08:36 ÅÄÔ  ÔHANKS FOR YOUR SUGGESTION. :)  ÈOWEVER, AS WE EXPLAINED, IT CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED.  ÙOU'RE SUGGESTION WOULD, THOUGH, WORK AS A STAND ALONE PROGRAM. ÔHE CURRENT "ÓÉÄ TUNER" PROGRAM DOES THAT WITH UNENHANCED ÓÉÄ FILES; É'M SORRY TO SAY THAT THE AUTHOR OF THAT FILE PASSED AWAY RECENTLY. :(  ×HETHER ÒOBERT WILL HAVE TIME TO WORK ON A STAND-ALONE VERSION OF YOUR SUGGESTION, É'M NOT CERTAIN. ÂUT É -WILL- PASS ALONG YOUR SUGGESTION TO HIM. :)  --ÌAURA--                   -::-ÍAIL ÆROM:  ÒOBERTÄATE:  ÔHURSDAY 26-ÏCT-89 16:44 ÅÄÔ  ÈIYA, ÒAYMOND. :)  ÒÅ: ÃLOBBER ERROR YOU'RE GETTING  ÔHE ÅDITOR'S PLAYER MODULE HAS A LOT MORE CAPABILITIES THAN ÓTEREOPLAYER (PLAY FROM A CERTAIN POSITION, MUTE SELECTED VOICES, INVERT RIGHT AND LEFT CHANNELS, ERROR REPORTING, ETC.) ÁLL OF THESE THINGS DECREASE THE CLOBBER TOLERANCE.  ÉF YOU LEAVE THE "ÃHANNEL ÄELAY" FEATURE SET AS 1 INSTEAD OF ZERO, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. ÔHIS STAGGERS COMMAND PROCESSING BETWEEN THE SIDES AND DOESN'T MAKE ANY NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY YOU HEAR THE ÓÉÄ (UNLESS THERE IS A HUGE POSITIVE ÊÉÆ IN THE SID).  ÁLSO, IF THE CLOBBER IS OCCURRING AT THE START OF THE SID, JUST START PLAYING AFTER MOVING TO THE FIRST ACTUAL NOTE IN THE SID.
