ÔHAT BREAKS ME UP.  :) É DON'T EVEN HAVE A CONTRACT! ÉF OUR CONTRIBUTORS WRITE FOR ME, É PAY THEM. ÊIM ÂUTTERFIELD USUALLY SENDS ME 4-6 COLUMNS IN ADVANCE, AND WE SEND HIM A CHECK. ÏUR OTHER CONTRIBUTORS WORK THE SAME WAY. ÒANDY ÔHOMPSON DECIDED THAT HE HAS TOO MUCH ON HIS SCHEDULE AT ÄYNAMIX AND HE HAD TO GIVE UP HIS COLUMN IN ÄECEMBER. ÄAVID ÐANKHURST IS TAKING OVER ÐROGRAMMER'S ÐAGE. ÈE HAS SENT IN COLUMNS AHEAD TOO, AND THE BEAT GOES ON!  ÔHERE'S NO GREAT CONSPIRACY HERE, FOLKS. ÐRINTING COSTS WENT UP TRMENDOUSLY AND THE NUMBE R OF ÇAZETTE SUBSCRIBERS ISN'T GREAT ENOUGH TO WARRANT PRINTING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT EDITIONS. ÁDDING ÇAZETTE TO ÁÌÌ EDITIONS WAS TOO EXPENSIVE TOO SINCE MOST OF ÃOMPUTE'S SUBSCRIBERS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 64/128.  É KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION THAT EVERYBODY WANTS, BUT TH ÄISK IDEA IS THE BEST WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW. ÉT WILL COST YOU MORE. É AM SORRY FOR THAT. ÉF É HAD MY WAY, YOU'D ALL GET THE DISK AT NO EXTRA CHARGE, BUT É'M NOT. ÉF YOU ARE REALLY NOT HAPPY, YOU CAN CANCEL RIGHT NOW. ÃALL (800) 727-6937 OR WRITE TO ÂOX 3244 IN ÈARLAN, ÉOWA, AND ASK FOR A REFUND ON UNUSED COPIES. É'LL POST MORE INFO AS É GET IT.

ÈE DID NOT READ THE LETTER.ÈE ALSO SAID AT A MEETING THAT COMPARING ÇAZETTE TO DIEÈARD, DIEÈARD HAD "SOUL". É LAID INTO THE TOPIC THAT EVERY TIME ÇAZETTE WAS MENTIONED, IT WAS BAD-MOUTHED. ÔHAT WE NEEDED TO SUPPORT ALL THE MAGS. (ÄIDN'T HELP HIM É GUESS, CAUSE HE PULLED THE ABOVE AT THE NEXT MEETING.)É PERSONALLY CAN'T STAND TO SEE ÇAZETTE BE BASHED. É THINK WE SHOULD SUPPORT AS MANY OF THE MAGAZINES AS POSSIBLE. ÉF YOU CAN ONLY SUPPORT ONE, É'D SAY TO SUPPORT THE ÇAZETTE FOR SEVERAL REASONS...#1 ÉT IS THE ONLY MAG BEING PUBLISHED BY A MAIN PUBLISHING HOUSE, AND NOT A HOBBIEST. ÔRANSLATES: ÉT IS MORE LIKELY TO STAY AROUND IF GIVEN HALF A CHANCE.#2 ÉT PAYS ITS CONTRIBUTORS REASONABLE RATES. (THEREBY BEING THE BEST PLACE FOR AUTHORS TO SUBMIT WORK. ÍANY AUTHORS WOULD PROBABLY NOT WRITE AT ALL IF ALL THEY COULD GET WAS AN EXTENSTION TO A SUBSCRIPTION.)#3 ÉT IS THE ONLY MAG THAT HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE 80S. ÔRANSLATES: ÔHE STAFF AND WRITERS ARE EXPERIENCED. ÔHEY WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HANDLE THE SITUATION THAN A HOBBIEST THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHING FOR 3 MONTHS.#4 ÉT HAS ARTICLES AT ALL LEVELS, UNLIKE SOME OF ITS COMPETITION.#5 ÉT HAS MORE USEFUL ARTICLES... IE: NOT 1/3 ÇÅÏÓ AND ÃÐ/Í AS SOME OTHER MAGS. (ÉT'S OK TO HAVE THESE, BUT NOT PAGES AND PAGES WORTH.)#6 ÉT'S THE MOST LIKELY MAG TO GO TO NEWSTAND PUBLICATION. ÉF THIS EVER CAME ABOUT, IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO ÇAZETTE THAN ANYONE ELSE.#7 ÂECAUSE ITS JUST, ER, UM, ÔÈÅ ÂÅÓÔ! ÇAZETTE ÒÕÌÅÚ!!! ÏH, SORRY :>ÍORE REASONS, BUT YOU GET THE IDEA.É THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ÇAZETTE. ÓOME OF THE USERS AROUND HERE WERE STRICT ÒÕÎ READERS. ÍAYBE THESE TYPE PEOPLE WILL NOT TOLERATE ÇAZETTE NO MATTER WHAT IT DOES. É KNOW THAT É PERSONALLY COULD NOT STAND ÒÕÎ, AND WOULD RATE IT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST OF Ã= MAGS.ÁT THIS POINT, WE NEED TO SUPPORT ÇAZ, ÇAZETTE, AND THE "NEW" DISK MAGAZINE. ÔHIS COULD BE OUR LAST CHANCE AT A MAJOR MAGAZINE. ÔHERE IS NO ROOM FOR WHINING ABOUT THE WAY WE THINK IT SHOULD BE, ETC. ÉF WE SPEND TIME DOING THAT, WHEN WE TURN AROUND, ÇAZETTE WILL BE GONE TOO.                     -::-ÓÕÂÊ: ÓOUL                       (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÇAZ         10/21/93   Ó#: 737801  É APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE EXPRESSED HERE (AND É HAD TO SMILE AT ÄROOPY'S COMMENTS!) É AM STILL WAITING FOR WORD ABOUT VARIOUS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND HOW THEY'LL BE HANDLED.

ÓOSMEONE SUGGESTED WE PUT MUSIC ON THE DISK EACH MONTH AND ASK FOR SUBSCRIBRS TO SEND IN TUNES, COMPSITIONS, AND THE LIKE. ÄOESN'T ÌOADSTAR DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ALREADY?  É DON'T WANT TO SIMPLY BE A COPYCAT UNLERESS WE COULD OFFER SOMETHING SPECIAL.×HAT ABOUT GRAPHICS? ÓHOUL WE TRY TO GET ÇAZETTE ÇALLERY GOING AGAIN OR HAS THAT IDEA COME AND GONE?
