IF YOU HAVE IT ON TAPE GO BACK & LOOK AT IT. JUST LISTEN FOR KATHY.ITS ALWAYS NICE TO GET GREAT NATIONAL PRIME TIME COVERAGE OF OUR GREAT MACHINES. I'VE SEEN ALOT OF COMMODORES ON T.V. & IN THE MOVIES. THERE WAS A BROWN C-64 ON ONE OF THE POLICE ACADAMIES, THERE USED TO BE ONE ON GENERAL HOSPITAL TOO, IT WAS THE WSB TERMINAL SHAWN USED. THERE WAS A VIC-20 ON THE FUNNY AIRPLANE SEQUAL WHERE THEY WERE IN SPACE. ALSO ONE OF THE RECENT COULMNS ON LOADSTAR TOLD OF A MOVIE IN WHICH A FLAT C-128 SAVES THE WORLD.
