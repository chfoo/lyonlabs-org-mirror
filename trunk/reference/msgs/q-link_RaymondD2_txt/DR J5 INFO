ÄR Ê5 ÆROM TIME TO TIME WE WILL BE SPOTLIGHTING ONE OF THE UPLOADERS IN THE MUSIC ROOM.  ÄR Ê5 IS ÊERRY ÒOTH, AN AUDIO TECHNICIAN BY OCCUPATION, AND ALSO ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR ÓID ARRANGERS IN THE MUSIC ROOM.  ÊERRY, HIS WIFE ÓUZANNE, AND THEIR LITTLE GIRLS ÍELISSA AND ÅRICA, AGES 10 AND 8 RESPECTIVELY, LIVE IN ÐHILADELPHIA, ÐENNSYLVANIA.  ÄR Ê5'S HOBBIES INCLUDE CHESS, ELECTRONICS, GUITAR, MATH, HIS COMPUTER (C64), AND ESPECIALLY MUSIC AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. ÇUITAR AND MUSIC THEORY LESSONS FORM ÄR Ê5'S PRIMARY MUSICAL BACKGROUND. ÈIS MUSICAL DEVELOPMENT WAS ENHANCED BY PLAYING LEAD AND RHYTHM GUITAR IN A ROCK GROUP FROM THE EARLY TO LATE 60'S. ÈE HAS TAKEN THE SKILLS HE LEARNED IN THE ROCK GROUP AND TRANSFERRED THEM TO THE SID EDITOR. ÁS ÊERRY STATES:    ÁS THE NEW POPULAR MUSIC SPRANG    UP THE SHEET MUSIC FOR IT DID NOT.    ÍOST OF THE BETTER GROUPS, EVEN    TODAY, RELY MAINLY ON BEING ABLE    TO DUPLICATE THE MUSIC AS CLOSE    TO THE RECORD AS POSSIBLE JUST    FROM LISTENING AND EXPERIMENTING.    É'VE ALWAYS PREFERRED TO DO AN    ARRANGEMENT FROM THE RECORD ITSELF,    AS OPPOSED TO STARTING OUT WITH    SHEET MUSIC.  ÔHIS HELPED OUT ALOT    WHEN 'ONE OF THE GUYS' WOULD COME    UP WITH AN ORIGINAL SONG.  É WOULD    ARRANGE IT FOR THE GROUP TO PLAY    OR RECORD.  ×HEN THE 'BASIC' SONG    IS ENTERED, IT CAN BE VARIED ONLY    SO MUCH.  ÓO IF É START OUT WITH    A PERSONAL ARRANGEMENNT, AS É    ADJUST IT FURTHER, IT BECOMES EVEN    MORE INTERESTING OR SOMETIMES    CLOSER TO THE ORIGINAL. ÄR Ê5 FIRST NOTICED ÓID MUSIC ON A LOCAL ÂÂÓ IN LATE 1985.  ÓHORTLY AFTER HE DID HIS FIRST ÓID, ÓURFER ÇIRL.  ÁS A LOT OF OTHERS INVOLVED IN ÓIDS, HE SAYS HE CRINGES EVERY TIME HE HEARS HIS FIRST ÓID!  ÊERRY SIGNED ON TO Ñ-ÌINK IN ÓEPTEMBER 1986 SHORTLY AFTER HEARING ABOUT THE VAST ÓID LIBRARY AND HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE. ÊERRY HAS DONE 27 SIDS TO DATE.  ÈE SAYS THAT COMPARED TO OTHERS THAT IS NOT ALOT, BUT EACH ÓID TAKES HIM ANYWHERE FROM 3 DAYS TO 2 WEEKS TO COMPLETE.  <ÐÒÅÓÓ Æ7 ÁÎÄ ÓÅÌÅÃÔ "ÇÅÔ ÎÅØÔ ÉÔÅÍ">
