ÍAIL ÆROM:  ÃRAIGÃ23ÄATE:  ÔUESDAY 7-ÎOV-89 21:54 ÅÓÔÈI ÒAYMOND... É GOT YOUR PHONE MESSAGE ABOUT KEYBOARDS AT ÒADIO ÓHACK FOR THE  Ã64.  É KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT É THINK É WILL WAIT UNTIL THEY STOP MAKING THE Ã64 AND STORES THEN TRY TO SELL THEM REAL CHEAP TO GET RID OF THEM, AND AT THAT TIME É WILL JUST BUY A NEW ONE.  ÁFTER ALL THAT THIS COMPUTER HAS BEEN THROUGH (3 BOOKS!) É DOUBT IF IT WILL LAST MUCH LONGER.  ÂUT THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION!  -ÃRAIGÐ.Ó. É GOT A MESSAGE FROM ÌEONETTE.
