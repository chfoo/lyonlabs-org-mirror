ÔHEY HAVE EVERY OTHER FORMAT IN CREATION (OKAY, THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE 8"), BUT HAVE NOT JUMPED INTO THE ÅNHANCED ÄENSITY WORLD YET. É'LL GIVE YOU THIS: ÉF YOU ARE USING AN ÉÂÍ CLONE (OR A ÍÁÃ?) AND THINK YOU NEED SOMETHING HIGHER IN DENSITY THAN ÈÄ, DON'T BOTHER WITH ÅÄ - GO RIGHT FOR THE FLOPTICALS (21 ÍÂ). ÔHERE IS JUST NO NEED FOR A 4ÍÂ (PRIOR TO FORMAT) DISKETTE ON AN ÉÂÍ SYSTEM...IN MY OPINION ANYWAY. ÂUT FOR ÃOMMODORE USERS? ÈELL, JUST FOR BACKUPS FROM ÒÁÍÌINK, IT'S ÖÅÒÙ MUCH NEEDED.                     -::-ÓÕÂÊ: *                          (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÃÍÄ         11/27/92   Ó#: 521025  ÁNGERED, NO. ÐERHAPS AMUSED THOUGH, SINCE WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SELLING THE ËÁÏ ÅÄ DISKS FOR $60.00/BOX OF 10 AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE ADVERTISED AS OUR RETAIL PRICE. ÔHIS WAS SET UP AS A SPECIAL OFFER FOR THOSE BUYING DISKS WITH AN ÆÄ4000, BUT É THINK THAT THE OFFER MAY BE EXTENDED TO INDIVIDUAL DISK ORDERS AS WELL. É POST CONCERNING THAT AS SOON AS É KNOW.                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: $$$                        (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÍR ÍOOR     11/28/92   Ó#: 522291  OK WELL I WAS LOOKING INTO THIS BEFORE TOO. I FOUND THEM FOR ABOUT $5.00 A DISK ($50/10) FROM ÂEST ÃOMPUTER ÓUPPLIES. THEY HAVE MANY BRANDS BUT THE PRICE LISTED IS FOR VERBATIM I THINK. JUST ASK THEM & THEY'LL READ OFF THE LIST. THIS WAS A MONTH OR 2 AGO AND THE PRICE MAY HAVE WENT DOWN. I WAS GOING TO ORDER FROM THEM BUT WITH ÃÏÄ, SHIPPING/HANDLING ETC IT CAME CLOSER TO $60/10 WHICH WAS THE SPECIAL PRICE FROM ÃÍÄ WITH THE DRIVE. I BELIEVE THEY ALSO SOLD ONE TYPE FOR $25/5 IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET.ÍR ÍOOR                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: SORRY                            ÆÒÏÍ: ÍR ÍOOR     11/28/92   Ó#: 522361  THE NUMBER FOR ÂEST ÃOMPUTER ÓUPPLIES IS 1-800-544-3472  M-F 6-6PM SAT 10-3 PACIFIC (CALIFORNIA) TIME.ÍR ÍOOR
