ÓÕÂÊ: 296+ FILES-ÓTEREOPLAYER          ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRENDA G4   05/29/90   Ó#: 45404   É WAS CHATTING WITH ÍARK THE OTHER NIGHT. ÈE ASKED ME TO POST THIS MESSAGE. ÈE SAYS THE NEW VERSION OF ÓTEREOPLAYER WILL SUPPORT 296 FILES. ÔHAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS FOR 1581 OWNERS!É AM GOING TO BE GETTING A ÃÍÄ ÈARD ÄRIVE, AND WOULD LIKE IT TO SUPPORT MORE THAN 296 FILES AND ÎATIVE ÍODE PARTITIONS. ÍARK SAID HE MIGHT TRY TO UP THE FILE LIMIT IF MANY PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED. ÈE DOESN'T HAVE A ÃÍÄ TO TEST IT ON THOUGH.ÉF YOU WOULD LIKE THE NEW ÓTEREOPLAYER TO SUPPORT MORE THAN 296 FILES, PLEASE SEND ÅMAIL TO ÍARK ÁÄ É. ÙOU CAN POST HERE TOO, BUT ALSO ÅMAIL ÍARK BECAUSE IT WILL BE EASIER FOR HIM TO TABULATE THAT WAY.ÔHANKS!!
