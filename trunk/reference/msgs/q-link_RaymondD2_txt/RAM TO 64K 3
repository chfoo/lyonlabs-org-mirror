 ÔHE NEXT STEP IS TO REMOVE THE SCREWS  HOLDING DOWN THE COMPUTER BOARD AND  THE GROUND CASING. ÔHERE WERE SIX  SCREWS AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE  MAIN BOARD/SHIELD ASSEMBLY, REMOVE  ALL OF THESE. ÔHEN YOU MUST USE THE  PLIERS TO GENTLY BEND THE TABS  HOLDING THE UPPER GROUND CASING TO  THE LOWER CASING. ÔHERE IS ONE MORE  SCREW MOUNTED ON THE GROUND CASING IN  ABOUT THE TOP MIDDLE, THIS MUST BE  REMOVED ALSO.  ÔHERE IS ONE SPOT WHERE THE CASING  HALVES WERE SOLDERED TOGETHER ON MY  COMPUTER AND THAT WAS IN THE FRONT  RIGHT SIDE, NEAR WHERE THE NUMERIC  KEYPAD SITS. ÃAREFULLY UNSOLDER THE  HALVES AND LIFT THE TOP HALF AWAY.  ×HAT YOU NOW SEE IS THE MAIN BOARD  WITH A SMALL METAL BOX ON IT, NEAR  THE CENTER OF THE BOARD. ÔHE CHIPS  THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED ARE INSIDE  THAT METAL BOX.  ÉNSIDE THE BOX ARE BOTH OF THE SCREEN  CONTROLLERS, THE 8564 ÖIC CHIP AND  THE 8563 ÖÄÃ CHIP. ÒEMOVE THE LID TO  THE BOX AND LOCATE THE TWO CHIPS THAT  ARE IDENTIFIED ON THE CIRCUIT BOARD  WITH THE MARKING Õ23 AND Õ25. ÏN MY  BOARD THESE CHIPS WERE LABELED WITH A  LARGE Æ AND THE PART NUMBER  ÍÂ81416-12. ÔHE NUMBER MAY VARY DUE  TO THE MANUFACTURER, BUT THE MARKINGS  ON THE BOARD WILL IDENTIFY THE  CORRECT CHIPS.  ÎOW FOR SOME VERY DELICATE SURGERY.  ÓINCE THE ÒÁÍ CHIPS WILL BE  DISCARDED, É SUGGEST THAT YOU  CAREFULLY CUT AWAY THE CHIP PINS  (LEADS) FROM THE BODY OF THE CHIP.  ÔHIS WILL MAKE REMOVING THE REMAINING  PORTION A LOT EASIER, AND LEAVES LESS  OF A CHANCE OF DAMAGING THE MAIN  BOARD THAN TRYING TO REMOVE THE WHOLE  CHIP, INTACT. ÔHE NEXT STEP IS TO  CAREFULLY UNSOLDER THE PINS FROM THE  CIRCUIT BOARD. ÍAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE  WORKING WITH THE CORRECT AREA, AS  THINGS DO GET RATHER CONFUSING WHEN  YOU TURN THE BOARD OVER AND NOTICE  ALL OF THE MANY SOLDERED AREAS. ÙOU  MIGHT BE BEST OFF TO MARK THE CORRECT  AREA WITH A FELT TIP PEN TO AVOID  CONFUSION.  ÔHE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO INSTALL THE  ÉÃ SOCKETS INTO THE CIRCUIT BOARD.  ÔRY FITTING THE SOCKETS INTO THE  BOARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WILL FIT  ALL OF THE WAY THROUGH THE HOLES AND  THAT THERE IS ENOUGH MATERIAL POKING  THROUGH FOR A GOOD SOLDER JOINT. ÁLSO  BE SURE TO ORIENT THE SOCKETS WITH  THE SMALL IDENTIFICATION NOTCH ON THE  CORRECT END OF THE BOARD. ÔHE NOTCH  IS PRINTED ON THE BOARD SO YOU SHOULD  HAVE NO TROUBLE.  ×HEN YOU HAVE THE SOCKETS INSTALLED  CORRECTLY, LIGHTLY BEND THE PINS OVER  TO HOLD THEM IN PLACE AND YOU'RE  READY TO SOLDER THEM IN PLACE. ÁGAIN  BE CAREFUL, AS DRIPS OF SOLDER CAN  CAUSE A SHORT, AND A COLD SOLDER  JOINT WILL CAUSE A POOR CONNECTION.  <ÐÒÅÓÓ Æ7 ÁÎÄ ÓÅÌÅÃÔ "ÇÅÔ ÎÅØÔ ÉÔÅÍ">
