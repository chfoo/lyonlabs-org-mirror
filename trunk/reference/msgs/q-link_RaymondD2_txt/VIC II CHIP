INDERIVING THE LINE RATE FROM ONE OF THE INPUT CLOCK RATES, THE RESULT BEING THEANOMALY MENTIONED (CHROMA SIGNAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE DOTS MAKING UP ACHARACTER WHERE SUCH INTERFERENCE WAS THE SAME IN ALL FRAMES DISPLAYED, THUSMAKING CHARACTERS UNREADABLE IN MANY COLOR COMBINATIONS).  ‘HE NEWER GENERATIONOF √64S DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM - THE DIVISOR WAS CORRECTED AND THE CHROMAINTERFERENCE AFFECTS ALTERNATE DOTS ON ALTERNATE FRAMES, THE NET RESULT BEINGREADABLE CHARACTERS.  ‘HIS SWITCHOVER SEEMS TO GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO THESWITCHOVER FROM A 5-PIN TO 8-PIN ƒ…Œ CONNECTOR FOR VIDEO OUTPUT, SO IF THE√64 YOU ARE CONSIDERING HAS THE OLDER 5-PIN CONNECTOR, CHANCES ARE GOOD THATIT ALSO HAS THE OLDER ÷…√ CHIP.ŒOTE THAT THE CHROMA INTERFERENCE PROBLEM ONLY APPLIES TO "COMPOSITE VIDEO"OUTPUT (INCLUDING THE “∆ MODULATED ‘÷ DISPLAY) FROM THE 64.  …F YOU USE AMONITOR CAPABLE OF "SEPARATED VIDEO" INPUT (E.G. THE √OMMODORE 1701, 1702,1802, 1902, AND SOME OTHERS), WHERE THE LUMINANCE IS INPUT SEPARATELY FROMTHE CHROMA SIGNAL, THE PROBLEM DOES NOT EXHIBIT ITSELF, SINCE THE CHROMAIS NOT PRESENT IN THE LUMINANCE SIGNAL, AND THEREFORE CANNOT INTERFERE.  œNESMALL PROBLEM: THE OLDER 64S (WITH 5-PIN CONNECTORS) DID NOT PROVIDE PURECHROMA OUTPUT (LUMINANCE YES, CHROMA NO).  ‘WO SOLUTIONS: JUST USE THE COMPOSITEVIDEO OUTPUT AS THE CHROMA (WORKS PRETTY WELL EXCEPT WHEN THE LUMINANCE PORTIONSATURATES THE CHROMA AMPLIFIERS AND THE DISPLAY GOES BLACK AND WHITE, OR WHENSINGLE DOT LUMINANCE SIGNALS CAUSE SOME FALSE COLOR TRIGGERING), OR OPENTHE 64, POP OFF THE COVER OF THE VIDEO CIRCUITRY SHIELD, AND LIFT THE END OF“10 (120 OHMS) FROM THE EMITTER OF —4 - THIS CHANGES COMPOSITE VIDEO INTOPURE CHROMA (THE “∆ MODULATER WILL BECOME USELESS AND THE 64 MUST NOW ALWAYSBE USED WITH A SEPARATED VIDEO MONITOR UNLESS THE RESISTOR IS RE-CONNECTED).ƒON'T TRUST YOUR √64 SCHEMATIC ON THIS ONE - THINGS ARE A BIT DIFFERENT INSIDETHE REAL MACHINE.  … RAN MY 64 WITH THIS MOD FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ANDTHE PICTURE ON A 1702 IS EXCELLENT (ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN A √128 WHICHSHOWS SOME VERTICAL STRIPING AT HIGH BRIGHTNESS).  …'VE ALSO RUN SOFTWAREGENERATED 80 COLUMNS THIS WAY AND THE RESULTS ARE QUITE READABLE, THOUGH THEDOT PITCH ON THE 1702 LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED IN THIS CASE.œNE MORE THING - THE UPDATE TO THE ÷…√ …… CHIP (CLOCK FREQUENCY CHANGE) MADETHE √64 *INCOMPATIBLE* WITH IT'S OWN √–/Õ EXPANSION INTERFACE!!  ”O ANOTHERWAY YOU CAN TELL, IS IF IT WORKS WITH A √–/Õ CARD, IT HAS THE OLD CHIP...∆RANK –RINDLE–RINDLE@Œ¡ƒ√.ARPA
