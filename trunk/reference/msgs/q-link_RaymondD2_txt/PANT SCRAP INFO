ÓÕÂÊ: PAINT-SCRAP                (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÄÅÎ Ó       06/07/89   Ó#: 849521  É DON'T THINK THE ÐAINT ÐAGES DRIVER WOULD INCLUDE THE COLOR INFO IF IT WAS USED FROM ÇEOÐUBLISH, SINCE ÇEOÐUBLISH DOESN'T SUPPORT COLOR...   ÔHE ANSWER IS, NO, ÐAINT-ÓCRAP DOESN'T SUPPORT COLOR - ÙÅÔ. ÉF É UPGRADE IT TO ALLOW COPYING AND PASTING FROM/TO ÇEOÐAINT FILES, É WILL TRY TO MAKE IT SUPPORT COLOR. É'VE GOT A FULL TIME JOB AND A FULL TIME HOME LIFE, THOUGH, SO É DON'T KNOW HOW SOON É'LL MAKE THE UPGRADES...   ÄOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE ÐAINT ÄRIVERS DO SUPPORT COLOR? ÁND FROM ÇEOÐUBLISH? ÏF COURSE, THAT'S ALL ACADEMIC FOR NOW.   É HOPE EVERYONE LIKES ÐAINT-ÓCRAP AS IT IS FOR NOW, THOUGH. É JUST SAW A NEED AND TRIED TO FILL IT. É HAVE ALOT OF FUN MIXING THE ÇEOÐUBLISH AND ÇEOÐAINT FEATURES TO MAKE SOME NEAT FULL PAGE GRAPHICS!   ÏF COURSE, É WROTE THIS FOR FUN, NOT PROFIT, AS SHAREWARE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR MY OTHER EFFORTS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN, WELL, DISAPPOINTING. ÂUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEND ME SOMETHING FOR THIS, SEND IT TO:           ÄENNIS ÓEITZ           7137 ÓNAKE ÒD.           ÏAKLAND, ÃÁ 94611ËEEP ON NERDING!!!!                    ÄÅÎ Ó    :)
