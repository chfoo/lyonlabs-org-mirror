ÉF ANYONE HAS ONE OR CAN POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, É'D CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT.  É WOULD BE WILLING TO TRADE A Ã-64 IN GOOD CONDITION FOR IT IF IT IS YOUR ONLY '64.  ÁLSO, IF ANYONE HAS OR KNOWS OF ÃOMMODORE COMPUTERS OR PERIPHERALS THAT HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DESIGN THAT MOST YOU'VE SEEN, LET ME KNOW.  É COLLECT ÃOMMODORE COMPUTERS AND ACCESSORIES, SO CHANCES ARE IF IT'S GOT THE ÃOMMODORE NAME ON IT AND É DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY, É'LL WANT IT.
