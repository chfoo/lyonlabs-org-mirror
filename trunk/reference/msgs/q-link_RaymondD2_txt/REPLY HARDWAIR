ÈELLO AGAIN.  ÔHANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!!! É DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU COULD PUT CAPACITORS TOGETHER TO ADD UP.  ÙES, É WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU PUT YOU ÓÉÄ CHIP AT $ÄÃ20. ÄID YOU ALL SO CHANCH THE PLAYER PORGRAM TO WORK WITH IT THERE? ÉN STEREO PLAYER É HAD TO CHANCH ABOUT 15 BYTES. ÉN THE STEREO EDITER É HAD TO CHANCH 1 BYTE AT $467Å IT WAS A ÁÄÃ #$Ä5 AND É PUT IT TO #$ÄÄ. É THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHANCH MORE THEN 1 BYTE TO WORK AT $ÄÃ20.  ÉS IT JUST AS EASY TO PUT IT AT $Ä700? É THINK THIS IS THE BEST PLACE BECAUSE ON THE 128 IT DON'T TAKE NO ÉÃ. É TOLD ÍARK, ÔHE PERSON WHO DID STEREO PLAYER THAT É GOT MY ÓID CHIP AT $Ä700 AND HE SAID HE WOULD LOOK IN TO IT, BUT É THINK YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS. ÓO IF YOU KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE NICE TO TELL ÍARK. ÈIS Ñ-ÌINK NAME IS ÍARK ÁÄ É.  ÙOU DID NOT SAY IF ANY PORGRAMS WORK WITH THE ADDED ÒAM. ÉS THERE ANY. É DON'T THINK É WILL DO THIS INTILL SOME ONE MAKE ÇEOS WORK WITH IT OR MAYBE SOME OTHER PROGRAM.  É AM GLAD THAT YOU ARE "ÁLWAYS HAPPY TO HELP!" É THINK YOU COULD HELP ME WITH A LOT OF THINGS. ÂUT É WOULD NOT WANT TO BUG YOU. ×HAT É ALL READY ASKED IS WHAT É WOULD REALY LIKE HELP ONE. ÔHANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP ALL READY!!!
