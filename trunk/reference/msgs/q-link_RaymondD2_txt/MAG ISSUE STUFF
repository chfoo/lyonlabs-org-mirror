 ÓÏÕÎÄ ÏÆÆ ÉÓÓÕÅ #2 ÔHE ÃOMMODORE COMPUTING COMMUNITY IS BLESSED WITH A LARGE CONTINGENT OF MAGAZINES. ÈOWEVER AS WE ALL KNOW NOT ALL MAGAZINES ARE CREATED EQUALLY. ÓOME MAGAZINE'S LIKE ÔWIN ÃITIES 128 AND ÁMIGA ×ORLD FOCUS ONLY ON ONE PARTICULAR ÃOMMODORE COMPUTER. ÏTHERS SUCH AS ÉÎÆÏ AND ÃOMMODORE ÍAGAZINE RENDER COVERAGE FOR ÃOMMODORE'S ENTIRE LINE OF COMPUTERS. ÓTILL OTHER MAGAZINES SUCH AS THE ÔRANSACTOR OR ÃÏÍÁÌ ÔODAY FOCUS ON PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF ÃOMMODORE COMPUTING. ÔHERE ARE STRONG ADVANTAGES AS WELL AS DISADVANTAGES TO EACH OF THESE MAGAZINE "STYLES", BOTH FOR THE READER AS WELL AS THE PUBLISHER.. ÉN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE MENTIONED DIFFERENCES, EACH OF THE PUBLICATIONS IN THE ÃOMMODORE WORLD VARY AS TO THEIR DEGREE AND THEIR INTENSITY AS FAR AS ÃOMMODORE 128 COVERAGE IS CONCERNED. ÒÕÎ, ÔWIN ÃITIES 128, ÃOMPUTE'S ÇAZETTE, ÔRANSACTOR, ÉÎÆÏ, AND ÁHOY ALL CLAIM THEY COVER THE ÃOMMODORE 128 COMPUTING AND YET EACH PUBLICATION TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THEIR COVERAGE. ÓO IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ÃOMMODORE ORIENTED PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE, WHICH DO YOU LIKE THE BEST?  ×HICH DO YOU FIND THE MOST ENTERTAINING?  ×HICH DO YOU FIND THE MOST INFORMATIVE AS FAR AS THE 128 IS CONCERNED? ×HICH PUBLICATIONS DO YOU FIND MOST USEFUL IN HELPING YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR COMPUTER, AND WHY? ÃOMPARE AND CONTRAST THE STYLES OF THE VARIOUS ÃOMMODORE COMPUTING PUBLICATIONS, AND COMMENT ON WHICH OF THEM YOU FIND PARTICULARLY USEFUL OR DISTRACTING, INTERESTING OR BORING, AND HOW THEIR STYLES AND APPROACH EFFECT THEIR ENTERTAINMENT AND OVERALL USEFULNESS. ÛÎOTE: ÂECAUSE É PUBLISH ÔWIN ÃITIES 128, WRITE A COLUMN IN ÒÕÎ, AND HAVE HAD ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN ÉÎÆÏ AND ÃOMMODORE ÍAGAZINES, É AM VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, INCLUDING WHAT CRITICISMS YOU MAY HAVE FOR MY WORK AND THE WORK OF OTHERS IN MY PROFESSION. ÄON'T HOLD BACK BECAUSE YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT MY FEELINGS OR THE FEELINGS OF ANY OTHER ÃOMMODORE JOURNALISTS ONLINE. ×E ARE BIG BOYS AND GIRLS, AND HAVE TO BE "THICK SKINNED" ENOUGH TO TAKE THE "ÇOOD, THE ÂAD, AND THE ÕGLY", JUST AS YOU DO WHEN YOU READ OUR STUFF!Ý --ÌOREN          <ÐÒÅÓÓ Æ5 ÆÏÒ ÍÅÎÕ>
