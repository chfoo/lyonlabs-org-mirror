ÓÕÂÊ: ÇÃ128 CONTINUES                  ÆÒÏÍ: ÎATEÆ       06/27/93   Ó#: 490790    ÎOW É'VE GOT THE BEAST READING AND WRITING DOCUMENTS.  É'VE ALSO FINISHED THE WINDOWING AND OPTIONS MENU.  ÎOW IT'S JUST THE COLOR SUPPORT AND THE PREVIEW/FULLVIEW ROUTINES.  ÔHEN É MUST GET ALL THE TOOLS WORKING TOO.  ÔHAT WON'T BE DIFFICULT.  É'M TWICE AS FAR AS É WAS WHEN É STOPPED BEFORE AND É'M THERE IN HALF THE TIME.  É FIGURE ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO AND IT'LL BE DONE.×E'RE STARTING TESTING OF GEOÃANVAS 3.0 WHICH USES DYNAMIC TOOLS MODULES (THE 128 VERSION WILL TOO).  ÔHIS MEANS THAT OTHER PROGRAMMERS CAN WRITE TOOLS TO WORK WITH GEOÃANVAS.  É'M STILL LOOKING FOR BETA-TESTERS FOR BOTH OF THESE VERSIONS.  ÁLSO, THE 128 VERSION.  É WAS THINKING EARLIER THIS MORNING THAT É CAN WRITE IT TO WORK ON EITHER 16Ë ÖÄÃ OR 64Ë ÖÄÃ RAM.  ÉN THE 16Ë IT WOULD HAVE TO SHORTEN THE HEIGHT OF THE SCREEN BY 24 LINES TO FIT IN THE COLOR, BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN GEOÐAINT 128 WITH IT'S NO-COLOR-AT-ALL.  É'LL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU POSTED.ÎATE  :)
