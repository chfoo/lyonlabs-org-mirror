×ÁÒÐ ÓÐÅÅÄ 2.0 ÕÐÇÒÁÄÅÔHE FIRST RELEASE OF ×ARP ÓPEED (×Ó)MET WITH MOSTLY POSITIVE REVIEWS FROMBOTH PUBLICATIONS AND END-USERS. ÔHEREARE, HOWEVER, TWO MAJOR BUGS AND ONEMAJOR DEFICIENCY IN THE 1.0 VERSION.1)  ÆOR THE LAST TWO YEARS ÃOMMODOREHAS BEEN SHIPPING A REDESIGNED VERSIONOF THE 64 CALLED THE 64Ã. ÉT FEATURES ARE-ENGINEERED CIRCUIT BOARD ANDCOSMETICALLY RESEMBLES THE 128 MODEL.ÏN CERTAIN PRODUCTION RUNS OF THE 64ÃTHE CHIP WHICH READS THE KEYBOARD WASUNAVAILABLE AND A NEARLY IDENTICAL CHIPWAS SUBSTITUTED. ÂECAUSE THE CHIP WASSUPPOSED TO BE FUNCTIONALLY THE SAME,ÃOMMODORE IN ALL INNOCENCE DID NOT FEELIT WAS NECESSARY TO NOTIFY DEVELOPERSOF THIS DIFFERENCE. ×ELL, AS IT TURNEDOUT THE CHIP BEHAVES IN A SUBTLYDIFFERENT MANNER THAT HAS CAUSED ×ARPÓPEED'S MOST ESSENTIAL FUNCTON,LOADING, TO FAIL ON MACHINES BUILT WITHTHAT CHIP. ÔHE FAILURE IS CHARACTERIZEDBY USERS RECEIVING THE MESSAGE "ÐRESSÐÌÁÙ AND ÒÅÃÏÒÄ" WHEN ATTEMPTING ALOAD. ÔHE NEW VERSION OF ×ARP ÓPEEDCHECKS FOR THE DIFFERENT CHIP ANDCORRECTS THE PROBLEM.2) ÔHE PRINTER OUTPUT FOR THE ÓECTORÅDITOR DID NOT WORK CORRECTLY ON MANYSYSTEMS. ÉNSTEAD OF PRINTING THECONTENTS OF THE CURRENT SECTOR ITPERFORMS A SCREEN DUMP ONLY INCLUDINGTHE FIRST HALF OF THE SECTOR, EVEN IFTHE USER WAS VIEWING THE SECOND HALF OFTHE SECTOR. ÔHE 2.0 VERSION PRINTS THEENTIRE SECTOR AS SPECIFIED.3) ÏNE OF THE NOTABLE FEATURES OFTHE ×ARP ÓPEED CARTRIDGE IS ITS SUPPORTFOR THE ÃOMMODORE 1581 3.5" DRIVE. ÍANYCOMPETING PRODUCTS CANNOT HANDLE 1581FILES; THE ÅPYX ÆAST ÌOAD CRASHES IF A1581 IS MERELY CONNECTED TO THECOMPUTER! ÍANY PEOOPLE WEREDISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THAT ×ARP ÓPEED'S1581 COMPATABILITY DID NOT INCLUDE FASTLOADING. ÓOME EVEN FELT THAT THE ×ARPÓPEED AD WAS MISLEADING IN THIS REGARD.ÔHE NEW RELEASE CONTAINS SEPARATELOADERS TO HANDLE THE 1581 AND SHOULDEND THIS COMPLAINT. ÖERY FEW COMPETINGCARTRIDGES SUPPORT FAST LOADING ON THE1581. ÁLL OF THE ONES ÃINEMAWARE HASSEEN ADVERTISED WITH THAT FEATURECARRIED A PRICE AT LEAST $10 HIGHERTHAN ×ARP ÓPEED.4) ÔHE 1.0 ×ARP ÓPEED VERSION WOULDCAUSE MANY POPULAR MODEM PROGRAMS TOCRASH. ÔHIS PROBLEM HAS BEENINVESTGATED AND FIXED IN THE NEWCARTRIDGE. ÎÏÔÅ: ÔHE POPULARÑUANTUM-ÌINK SYSTEM IS NOT COMPATIBLEWITH EITHER VERSION OF ×ARP ÓPEED.Ñ-ÌINK IS ACCESSED THROUGH DEDICATEDSOFTWARE THAT CRASHES IN THE PRESENCEOF MANY CARTRIDGES. ÔHIS WOULD APPEARTO BE A FORM OF COPY PROTECTION BUT ITIS UNCLEAR WHY ONE WOULD WANT TOPROTECT THIS PARTICULAR SOFTWARE. <ÐÒÅÓÓ Æ7 & ÓÅÌÅÃÔ "ÇÅÔ ÎÅØÔ ÉÔÅÍ">                   -::-ÙOU MAY UPGRADE TO THE NEW VERSON OF×ARP ÓPEED (2.0) BY SENDING $10 ANDYOUR EXISTING CARTRIDGE TO ÃINEMAWARE.ÐLEASE INCLUDE THE LINE "Ã/Ï ÃUSTOMERÓERVICE" ON THE PACKAGE.
