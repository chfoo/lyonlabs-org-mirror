ÓÕÂÊ: 1581 V6.02 ÒÏÍÓ            (Ò5)  ÆÒÏÍ: ÔÄÈ         05/19/90   Ó#: 47969   É JUST RECEIVED MY NEW UPGRADED 1581 ÒOMS A FEW WEEKS AGO BUT É HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEM. ÏNE FUNCTION THAT DOES NOT WORK IS THE COMBINE FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN MERGE TWO SEQ FILES TOGETHER INTO ONE FILE ON THE SAME DRIVE. ÉT WORKS GOOD ON BOTH OF MY 1571 DRIVES BUT NOT ON EITHER OF MY 1581 UPGRADED DRIVES. É ALSO HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME DISK CORRUPTION PROBLEMS WHILE DOWNLOADING FROM Ñ-ÌINK. ÈAS ANYBODY ELSE REPORTED SUCH PROBLEMS?                                    ÔIM ÈAUPT                  Á HAPPY ÊÄ ÏWNER                  (JUST WISH ÁÌÌ THE                   BUGS WERE ÓÑÕÁÓÈÅÄ)                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: É ÄONT                     (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÎEWT        05/20/90   Ó#: 506957  KNOW IF THIS IS RELATE ÊIM, BUT É FOUND THAT IN MY IMAGE BBS É HAD TO CHANGE A COPY AND COMBINE COMMAND TO GET IT TO WORK ON THE ÈÄ. ÃOULD BE THE SAME PROBLEM YOU ARE HAVING WITH YOUR 1581.ÂASICALLY YOU HAVE TO USE THE BELOW FORMAT IN THE COMMAND.OPEN15,DV,15:PRINT#15,"Ã[N]:NEWFILE=[N:]FILENAME[,[N:]FILENAME...]×HERE:DV        =THE CURRENT DEVICE NUMBERN         =THE PARTITION# OR DRIVE #NEWFILE   =THE NAME OF THE FILE CREATEDFILENAME  =THE NAME OF FILE(S) BEING            COPIED.ÔHE COMMAND STRING IN MY BBS WAS AS BELOW:OPEN15,8,15:PRINT#15,"Ã[N]:NEWFILE=:FILENAME,FILENAME..ÓO THE DRIVE NUMBER OR PARTITION NUMBER HAS TO BE PLACED BEFORE EACH FILE.É ALSO TRIED DOWNLOADING FROM Ñ-LINK TO MY ÈÄ TONIGHT AND GOT AN ERROR LIGHT.                       ÎE×T                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: ÃÏÐÙ COMMAND               (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÃÍÄ         05/20/90   Ó#: 53281   ×E'LL TEST FOR THESE PROBLEMS ÁÓÁÐ. É HAVE BEEN DOWNLOADING TO THE ÈÄ WITHOUT PROBLEMS HERE, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE DONE TO ANY PARTITION TYPE EXCEPT 1541 UNLESS THE PARTITION HAS BEEN PATCHED FOR IT. ÔHIS IS BECAUSE THE Ñ SOFTWARE CHECKS THE LINK AT TRACK 18 SECTOR 0 TO FIND WHERE THE DIRECTORY IS LOCATED. ÔHE ÃÏÐÙ COMMAND PARSING ON THE ÈÄ DID HAVE A KNOWN BUG IN THE RELEASE VERSION WHICH CAUSED IMPROPER PARSING TO THE RIGHT OF THE EQUALS SIGN IN SOME CASES.                     -::-ÓÕÂÊ:   ×ELL,                    (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÎEWT        05/20/90   Ó#: 521290  THAT EXPLAINS IT THEN É WAS TRYING TO DOWNLOAD TO A NATIVE PARTITION.                          ÎE×T                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: ÎO PROBLEM HERE.           (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRADÈ3      05/21/90   Ó#: 40237      É'VE BEEN DOING Ñ-ÌINK DOWNLOADS TO A ÎATIVE PARTITION OF ABOUT 5 ÍEGS ON MY ÈÄ-20 EVER SINCE I GOT IT.  É HAVE YET TO GET THE FIRST ERROR.

ÆÒÏÍ: ÃÍÄ         05/22/90   Ó#: 55923   ÕSUALLY IT ISN'T A PROBLEM ÂRAD, É DO IT TOO, BUT IF Ñ FINDS INFO IT DOESN'T LIKE WHEN IT CHECKS FOR THE DIRECTORY, AN ERROR ÃÁÎ OCCUR. ÕSUALLY THIS WORKS, SINCE THE Ñ SOFTWARE DOES NOT DIRECTLY MANIPULATE THE ÂÁÍ AND DIRECTORY, JUST CHECKS IT FIRST.ÁS TO THE 1581, ÍARK AND É HAVE BOTH CHECKED THE STATED PROBLEM, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE IT. ÍAYBE SOME MORE INFO WOULD HELP, BUT THE ÃÏÐÙ COMMAND SEEMS TO WORK FINE ON OUR DRIVES WITH THE LATEST ÒÏÍ. É ALSO HAVE NO PROBLEM DOWNLOADING TO MY 81 AS LONG AS É PATCH IT FIRST. ÙOU MAY WANT TO TRY IT WITH LESS PERIPHERALS ATTACHED TO THE SYSTEM TO SEE IF YOU ARE GETTING CAUGHT BY SERIAL BUS LOADING PROBLEMS. ÓWAPPING CABLES MAY HELP AS WELL, SINCE ÊIFFYÄÏÓ USES A TWO BIT PARALLEL DATA TRANSFER INSTEAD OF THE ONE BIT SERIAL METHOD.
