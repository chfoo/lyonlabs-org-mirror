ÁPPLICATIONS. ÂECAUSE THE EMITTER-COLLECTOR CURRENTIS UP TO SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES GREATERTHAN THE EMITTER-BASE CURRENT, THETRANSISTOR QUALIFIES AS AN EFFICIENTCURRENT AMPLIFIER. ÉN A TYPICALAPPLICATION, A SMALL CURRENT GENERATEDBY A VOICE DIRECTED TOWARD A MICROPHONEIS APPLIED TO THE BASE OF A TRANSISTOR.ÔHIS SMALL BASE CURRENT CONTROLS THEMUCH LARGER EMITTER-COLLECTOR CURRENTTHAT IS APPLIED TO THE TERMINALS OF ALOUDSPEAKER, WHICH EMITS A GREATLYAMPLIFIED SOUND. Á JUNCTION TRANSISTOR MAY ALSO BE USEDAS AN ELECTRONIC SWITCH. ÂELOW A POINTKNOWN AS SATURATION, OR CUTOFF, THERATIO OF THE BASE CURRENT TO THEEMITTER-COLLECTOR CURRENT IS CONSTANT.ÁT SATURATION THE TRANSISTOR REACHESITS HIGHEST POSSIBLE CONDUCTIVITY, ANDFURTHER INCREASES IN BASE CURRENT FAILTO INCREASE THE EMITTER-COLLECTORCURRENT. Á COMPARATIVELY SMALL BASECURRENT EASILY SATURATES A TRANSISTORINTO FULL CONDUCTION AND CAUSES IT TOACT AS A SOLID-STATE ON-OFF SWITCH.ÔHIS MODE OF OPERATION HAS MANY USES,PARTICULARLY IN DIGITAL ELECTRONICCIRCUITS. ÖIRTUALLY IDENTICAL ACTION OCCURS INPNP UNITS, THE SINGLE EXCEPTION BEINGTHAT HOLES RATHER THAN ELECTRONS ARETHE PRINCIPAL CARRIERS OF CURRENT.ÃONSEQUENTLY, THE POLARITY OF CURRENTAPPLIED TO A PNP TRANSISTOR IS OPPOSITETHAT APPLIED TO AN NPN DEVICE. ÂOTHTYPES ARE USED EQUALLY IN ELECTRONICCIRCUITS.
