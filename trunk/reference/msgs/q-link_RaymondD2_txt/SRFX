ÔHE 2ND TIME AROUND IT STARTS TO GET LIGHT NOT NIGHT. É AM USEING THE ÆÔÙ CAR. ÔHE LEFT RIGHT BUTTONS HELP SOME BUT É HARDLY USE THEM. É JUST LET UP ON THE GASS TO GO AROUND THE CORNERS. ÔHE VERY LAST TRACK IS HARD. ÉT HAS 3 HOLF ROUND TOBES. ÏNE AT THE END THE LEFT SIDE IS CUT OFF AND YOU WILL GO IN THE WATER. ÔRY TO GET AS MUTCH TIME AS YOU CAN. ÔHE MOST É SEEN THAT É HAS WAS 25 SEC. SO THAT LEFT ME 75 SEC. ÍY BE NEXT TIME É PLAY IT É CAN GET ALL THE WAY PAST THE LAST TRACK. ÈAS ANY ONE ELSE.    ÄRIVING IS LIKE THE STEARING HAS A RUBBER BAND ON IT. É GUESS IF IT WAS NOT LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE TO EASY. ÏR MAYBE THAT'S HOW YOU DRIVE IF YOU ARE DUNK! ÉS ÎINTENDO TRYING TO SAY DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE? ÂUT THEN IF YOU WIN ARE THEY SAYING, SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU DRINK AND DRIVE.   ÔHIS CART. HAS A 64K ÒÁÍ CHIP IN IT ALL BACKED UP. ÂUT É AM SURE THE ÃÐÕ BILT IN USES A LOT OF THAT ÒÁÍ.   ÓEGA'S ÖIRTUA ÒACING COST ABOUT $80, WAS $99. ÎINTENDO'S ÓTUNT ÒACE ÆØ, JUST $60. É BET YOU CAN FIND IT FOR $50 NOT TO LONG FROM NOW. ÓEGA'S WAS $99 NOW IT'S $80 SO É THINK ÓTUNT ÒACE ÆØ WILL COME DOWN IN PRICE TOO. É ONLY HAD IT FOR 2 DAYS NOW, BUT É THINK É PLAYED IT AROUND 8 OR SO HOURS.                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: É MADE IT!

TO ADD TO THE TIME. ÁT THE END É ONLY HAD 1 SEC. LEFT WHEN É PAST THE FINNISH LINE. ÔHE BEST TIMES É GOT ON ALL THE LAST 4 TRACKS WITH THE ÆÔÙ CAR ARE IN ORDER OF THE TRACKS, 2'18"34, 3'33"59, 3'15"31, AND 3'38"22. ÔHE LAST ONE WITH THE 4×Ä IS EASY. É GOT A 3'24"16 USING THE 4×Ä. ÂUT IT'S HARD TO GET PAST THE OTHER 3 TRACKS WITH THE 4×Ä. ÙOU WILL SEE THAT SEC.'S GOING DOWN JUST BEFORE EVERY CHECK PONT. É NOW CAN RACE ON ALL 12 TRACKS OR 15 TRACKS, IN THE ÆREE ÔRAX MADE. É CAN USE THE 2×Ä IN ALL OF THEM NOW TOO :)                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: 2×Ä FUN :)                 (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ×IGGLE×ORM  07/24/94   Ó#: 766785     É MADE IT IN ÍASTER ÃLASS 2 TIMES USING THE 2×Ä! ÉT IS FUN. ÙOU CAN GO SUPER FAST USING THE Ì AND Ò CONTROLLERS. ÙOU CAN GO AT FULL SPEED ALL MOST ALL AROUND THE TRACKS. ÔHE Õ TERNS ARE A LITTLE HARD. É USE THE BRACK AND Ì OR Ò THEN TERN FAST. ÎO MATTER HOW FAST YOU GO THE OTHER CARS ARE ALL WAYS BEHIND YOU. ÂUT WITH THE 2×Ä YOU CAN GET LOSE BALANCE EASY. ÉT SEEMS BETTER TO STAY UP TO SPEED. ÂUT BOY IS IS FUN WIPPING AROUND THE TRACKS IF YOU DO IT JUST RIGHT. ÈAVE TO START TERNING A LITTLE BEFOR THE TERNS.   ÔHE 4×Ä IF YOU CAN MAKE IT PAST THE 1ST 3 COURSES IN ÍASTER IT SHOULD BE ESEE ON THE 4 COURSE.   Ï YES THE CAR É WAS USING AT FRIST WAS THE Æ-ÔYPE É THOUGHT IT WAS ÆÔÙ BUT THAT WAS IN THE REGISTRATION É GUESS FOR Æ-ÔÙPE.   ÉT'S A FUN GAME USING THE 2×Ä.
