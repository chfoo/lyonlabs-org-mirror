ÍAIL ÆROM:  ÇÈ ×ELLSÄATE:  ÓUNDAY 4-ÄEC-88 02:12 ESTÉ LIKE THE NOVEL IDEA OF YOUR DRIVERVERY MUCH AND É THINK YOU SHOULD PRESENTIT AS ONE THAT REDUCES A FONT IN THEVERTICAL DIRECTION TO GET THE ADDITIONALRESOLUTION.  ÈOWEVER, É WOULD SUGGESTTHAT YOU MAKE ONE MORE CHANGE AT ADDRESS7A18 CHANGING THE 5E TO BD.  ÔHIS WILLDOUBLE THE PAGE LENGTH (WHICH ONLYGEO×RITE CAN HANDLE) SO THAT A DOCUMENTWILL PRINT OUT NORMALLY.  ÄID YOU KNOWTHAT GEO×RITE CAN HANDLE A DOCUMENT THATIS 28.33 INCHES LONG AT THE NORMAL 72DPI?  ÇEO×RITE 1 WILL ONLY ALLOW YOU TOPREVIEW THE TOP 10 INCHES AND GEO×RITE2 WILL ONLY ALLOW YOU TO PREVIEW THE TOP10.45 INCHES, BUT THE PAGE WINDOW AT THETOP OF THE SCREEN IS AUTOMATICALLYSCALED BASED ON THE PAGE LENGTH.   ÓO IFYOU SET THE PAGE LENGTH IN YOUR DRIVERTO THE LONGER VALUE, YOU CAN USEGEO×RITE PERFECTLY WELL ON AN 8 BY 10.45INCH DOCUMENT.  ÙOUR DRIVER ALSO ADDSRESOLUTION TO GEOÐAINT SCRAPS PASTEDINTO A GEO×RITE DOCUMENT.  ×HAT ISREALLY NEEDED NOW IS A SPECIAL FONT THATIS DOUBLE HIGH SO THAT IT PRINTS WELLWITH YOUR DRIVER.  ÇEO×RITE ADDS TWOBLANK PIXELS BETWEEN PRINTED LINES SOTHAT FONT SHOULD INCLUDE TWO BLANKPIXELS AT THE TOP SO THAT IT WILL PRINTNORMALLY.  ÄID YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOUDO IN YOUR DRIVER IS SIMILAR TO WHATÁPPLE DOES WITH THE ÍACINTOSH FOR HIGHQUALITY PRINTING?  ÙOUR DRIVER IS GREAT!   ÐÓ.  Ø-STRA IS SPELLED "EXTRA".  ÄOYOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH YOUR SPELLINGBECAUSE ÅNGLISH IS A SECOND LANGUAGE?ÉT CERTAINLY HASN'T HINDERED YOURPROGRAMMING ABILITIES, ESPECIALLY FORSOMEONE MORE FAMILIAR WITH A DIFFERENTÃÐÕ AND WITHOUT THE AID OF AN ASSEMBLER.É'M REALLY IMPRESSED!  ËEEP UP THE GOODWORK!                ÇEORGE
