ÓÕÂÊ: ÐOSSIBLE PROBLEM           (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ËNICK       04/19/89   Ó#: 421334   ÔHE SOLDER JOINTS IN SOME MONITORS HAVE CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS. É HAD TO HAVE MINE RESOLDERED (COST ME $30) BECAUSE MY MONITOR WOULD SUDDENLY 'GO BLACK' AT RANDOM TIMES. ÏNLY REST WOULD HELP. É DID NOT, HOWEVER, EXPERIENCE THE 'DOTS' NOR 'LINES' WHICH YOU DO, BUT IT IS WORTH CHECKING OUT. ÍY MONITOR IS A ÍAGNAVOX 8563 ÒÇÂÉ WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS A 1902Á (WHICH É THINK WAS MADE BY ÍAGNAVOX, BUT É COULD EASILY BE WRONG ABOUT THIS). ÃOLD SOLDER JOINTS--THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM FOR MANY ON Ñ.
