ÓÕÂÊ: DL HELPERS, LOOK HERE      (Ò2)  ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRENDA G4   08/27/94   Ó#: 403032  É HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS ON THIS... ONE OF MY IDEAS IS TO (UM THIS IS COMPLEX) USE ÓUPER ÓNAPSHOT TO GET A PRINTOUT OF ALL THE STUFF IN THE LIBRARIES. (×E ALL KNOW THAT THE ÓOFTWARE ÄIRECTORIES ARE NOT UP TO DATE.) ÔHEN MAYBE IT CAN BE SCANNED, PUT INTO A FILE, AND WE CAN PASS THE FILE AROUND. ×E CAN USE IT TO SEE WHAT WE DON'T HAVE OR WHATEVER.×E COULD EACH TAKE A SECTION TO WORK ON. ÂUT FIRST WE NEED TO SEE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE.ÉF YOU WANT TO HELP, EMAIL ME.ÓINCE WE CAN'T UPLOAD HERE, É THINK THE EASIEST WAY WOULD BE TO USE MY ÂÂÓ.×E COULD RUN ALL THE DISKS THROUGH MY PROGRAM. ÔHEN WE WOULD ALL HAVE STANDARDIZED, ONE FILE, ALPHABETIZED LISTINGS. É'M WILLING TO PUT EVERYONE'S LIST ON MY ÁMIGA.ÅVEN IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE MY PROGRAM, WE COULD UPLOAD THE LISTS FROM WHATEVER PROGRAMS TO MY ÂÂÓ. ÔHEN OTHERS COULD JUST DOWNLOAD THEM.É WILL SET UP AREAS ON MY ÂÂÓ OR DO ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT HELP.É PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO GET THE FILES IN THE ORIGINAL FORM. (MEANING .SDA, .ARC OR WHATEVER.) É ALSO SAVE THE FILE DESCRIPTION WITH AN ÅNGLISH POUND SYMBOL IN FRONT OF THE NAME. (ÔHIS IS BECAUSE MY ÂÂÓ USES THIS TO SHOW FILE DESCRIPTIONS.)ÒIGHT NOW, É AM THINKING THAT THE BEST WAY WOULD BE TO SAY, OK, ÊOHN ÓMITH GO DO THE ØÙÚ AREA. ÁLL OF US COULD CHECK THE ÓUPERÓNAPÓHOT PRINTOUTS, AND SEE IF WE HAD THE FILES ALREADY. ÉF WE DO, WE SEND THEM TO ÊOHN. (ÏR MY ÂÂÓ.) ÉF WE DON'T, THEN WE SAY OK ÊOHN GO DOWNLOAD THEM.É'M NOT PLANNING TO RE-CREATE THE Ñ LIBRARIES ON MY ÈÄ. ÉT'S JUST THAT WE NEED A PLACE TO GET THE STUFF ALL TOGETHER, SO WE CAN BE SURE WE HAVE ALL WE WANT.ÍY ÂÂÓ # IS 206-536-4689. ÉT'S 1200-14.4. É DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF LONG DISTANCE BILLS WE WOULD BE TALKING HERE. ÂUT É WOULD THINK THAT 14.4 WOULD GET IT DONE PRETTY FAST.ÉF THE STUFF WAS SENT TO MY ÂÂÓ, WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT ABOUT GETTING IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HELPED. É DON'T KNOW HOW MASSIVE IT IS GOING TO BE, SO É WON'T COMMENT NOW ON HOW TO GET IT OUT TO PEOPLE WHEN IT IS DONE.É MEAN, YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DOWNLOAD HUNDREDS OF DISKS, AND É DON'T WANT TO COPY AND MAIL THEM BY MYSELF EITHER :>ÁNYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS ON ANY OF THIS?                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: ÁN UNLIKELY POSSIBILITY    (Ò1)  ÆÒÏÍ: ÐROFÎÅ×ÔÏÎ  09/01/94   Ó#: 463706  É DID SEE ON ANOTHER BBS THAT SOMEONE HAD SUGGESTED TO Ñ THAT THEY MAKE OR ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE A CD-ROM "SNAPSHOT" OF THEIR TOTAL SOFTWARE COLLECTION.
