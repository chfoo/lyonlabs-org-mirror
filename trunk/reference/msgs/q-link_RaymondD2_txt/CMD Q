É SUSPECT THAT THE COMPUTER THAT SUPPORTS ÑÌINK IS THE SAME ONE THAT SUPPORTS ÁÏÌ AND THAT IS THE MAIN REASON WHY ÑÌINK HAS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL, AS MORE AND MORE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO ÁÏÌ.                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: .                                ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRENDA G4   10/15/94   Ó#: 75475   ÙES, É KNOW. ÂUT COULDN'T A SEPARATE COMPUTER BE PURCHASED? ÃÍÄ COULD DO IT A LITTLE AT A TIME... IE: PUT UP A SMALL VERSION OF THE SYSTEM. ÏR EVEN SOMETHING LIKE GET ÁÏÌ TO KEEP Ñ UP SO ÃÍÄ CAN UPGRADE IT. ÁÏÌ STILL HAS A MONEY MAKER IF THEY WOULD MANAGE IT PROPERLY. É KNOW ÁÏÌ HAS ALWAYS SAID NO ONE CAN LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE. (×ELL, É REALLY DON'T THINK THEY ARE ALL THAT SPECIAL, É THINK EVERY ONLINE SERVICE KNOWS WHAT THEY KNOW.) ×ELL, THAT WAS BACK WHEN, WHEN THEY HAD NOT DECIDED TO FOLD YET. ÍAYBE THEY MIGHT CHANGE THEIR MIND WHEN Ñ HAS GONE FROM $$$$$$$ AT FIRST, TO $, AND THEN TO $0 NOW.                     -::-ÓÕÂÊ: CMD & Q??                  (Ò1)  ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRENDA G4   10/13/94   Ó#: 75099   É WOULD LIKE TO SEE ÃÍÄ PURCHASE THE Ñ-ÌINK LIBRARY AND OFFER IT ON ÃÄ. ÅVEN IF THAT MEANS WE MUST USE AN É*Í ;) TO ACCESS IT. ÉT COULD BE MARKETED TO OWNERS OF OTHER COMPUTERS ÁÎÄ ÃOMMODORE OWNER. ÏWNERS OF OTHER COMPUTERS WOULD USE THEIR 64  EMULATORS. ÃOMMODORE OWNERS MAY ALSO HAVE ANOTHER COMPUTER TYPE, AND MIGHT BE WILLING TO COPY THE ÃÄ BACK DOWN TO FLOPPIES TO USE ON THE 64/128.ÐERSONALLY, É WOULD BUY A ÃÄ-ÒÏÍ PLAYER FROM ÃÍÄ FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS *EVEN IF* THE ONLY AVAILABLE ÃÄ WAS THE Ñ-ÌINK ÃÄ. (É'D ALSO BUY A TAPE BACKUP, BUT ÃÍÄ DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT MARKET EXISTS EITHER ;) )ÔHE MASS DOWNLOAD GANG IS GOING TO CHECK INTO PUTTING FILES ONTO ÃÄ. ÂUT IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO GET THEM ALL IN ONE PLACE AND ORGANIZED SO THAT THIS COULD BE DONE. ÄOING IT STRAIGHT FROM Ñ-ÌINK, WHERE IT IS ALL THERE (THE BACKUPS) AND ORGANIZED, WOULD BE EASY.(ÔHERE ARE PLACES THAT WILL TRANSFER FROM ANY FORMAT TO ÃÄ FOR A FEE. É SAW AN AD FOR A PLACE THAT WOULD MAKE A ÃÄ FOR YOU FOR $89.)ÓINCE É DON'T THINK ÃÍÄ WANTS TO DO A ÃÄ-ÒÏÍ, HERE'S A WILD IDEA... ÃÍÄ COULD SELL A 1 ÇÉÇ DRIVE WITH ALL THE Ñ-ÌINK FILES INSTALLED FOR A FEE. (ÉS THAT BIG ENOUGH? ;) )ÔELL ÃÍÄ YOUR OPINION!!                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: É LOVE IT...                     ÆÒÏÍ: ÂILL ÍARS   10/15/94   Ó#: 75514   ÐERSONALLY É WOULD PREFER THE ÉÂÍ FORMAT, SINCE É RUN MY ÂÂÓ OFF AN ÉÂÍ PLATFORM (MY MACHINE OF CHOICE IS MY 128).  É HAVE A PERMINATE NULLMODEM CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO COMPUTERS (ACTUALLY É HAVE FULL 4 CLONE NETWORK SETUP IN THE HOUSE, PARTLY FOR THE ÂÂÓ TO BE).ÏNE OF THE PROJECTS PROPOSED ON THE NETS IS A MASSIVE ÃÄ ÒÏÍ FOR COMMODORES SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE IDEA OF THE Ñ-ÌINK FILE BASE.  ÉT IS CHEAPER THAN YOU WOULD THINK TO MAKE A ÃÄ, THE HARD PART IS GATHERING THE FILES (É'VE PERSONALLY TALKED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY KNOW BUSINESSES THAT DO IT).
