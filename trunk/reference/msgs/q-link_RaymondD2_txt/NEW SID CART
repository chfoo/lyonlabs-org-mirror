ÓÕÂÊ: ÎEW ÓÉÄ ÓYMPHONY CART      (Ò3)  ÆÒÏÍ: ÄR ÅVIL     03/20/90   Ó#: 487268  ÈI ALL!ÒICK (ÑÄÊ ÆIXXIT) AND É HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK TO POLISH THE DESIGN ON THE NEW, BATTERYLESS ÓÉÄ ÓYMPHONY ÓTEREO ÃARTRIDGE.  ×E HAVE HAD MANY THINGS TO IRON OUT BECAUSE THE CART, BESIDES REQUIRING NO BATTERY (OR WIRES, ETC.), HAS SOME CIRCUITRY TO HELP PREVENT STATIC DAMAGE AND SOMETHING CALLED "ÓÃÒ LOCKUP" WHICH HAS HIT A FEW PEOPLE'S CARTS.ÁNYWAY, OUR GOAL IS TO PRICE THE CARTRIDGE AT $34.95, JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL DESIGN.  É THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS AN EVEN BETTER VALUE THAN BEFORE BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE PLUNKING DOWN $$ FOR REPLACEMENT BATTERIES!ÈOWEVER, IT IS TAKING QUITE A BIT OF TIME TO FIND JUST THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF PARTS TO DO THE JOB ÁÎÄ DO IT COST-EFFECTIVELY.  ÁLSO, WHEN É GAVE THE DEMO THAT ÂRENDAÇ4 SAW AND POSTED ABOUT HERE, WE WERE "SURE" WE COULD DO IT FOR $34.95.  ÔHEN, IT LOOKED LIKE WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO USE A MORE- EXPENSIVE KIND OF PART... BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB MUCH MORE CHEAPLY.ÔHE POINT OF THIS IS: WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP THE CART AT $34.95, BUT IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE.  ÁND, IT IS TAKING US LONGER THAN WE HAD HOPED TO GET THINGS ROLLING--BUT IT WILL BE TIME WELL SPENT.ÐLEASE BEAR WITH US ON THIS--WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE PRETTY SOON.ËENT ÓULLIVANÄR.
