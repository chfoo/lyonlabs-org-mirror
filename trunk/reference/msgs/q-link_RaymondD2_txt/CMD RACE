ÊUST AS É WAS ENTERING TURN TWO, AND WITHOUT WARNING, A CONNECTING ROD BROKE AND SENT A PISTON UP INTO THE CYLINDER HEAD AND BROKE THE HEAD IN TWO. ÔHIS SENT COOLANT ALL OVER MY TIRES AND É NEARLY SPUN THE CAR INTO THE OUTSIDE WALL. É MANAGED TO GET THE CAR STRAIGHTENED OUT AND COASTED INTO THE PITS, OUT OF THE RACE. ÔHIS DID NOT BRING OUT A CAUTION FLAG. ÐOSSIBLY THE LACK OF HORSEPOWER DURING QUALIFYING LED TO THE EVENTUAL PROBLEM IN THE RACE. ÂUT É DID MANAGE TO QUALIFY AND STARTED IN THE REAR OF THE FIELD. ÉF YOU WATCH A TAPE OF THE RACE AGAIN, WATCH THE VERY START AND YOU WILL SEE A RED AND GREEN CAR DART TO THE OUTSIDE ON THE FRONT STRAIGHTAWAY AND PASS SEVERAL CARS BEFORE GETTING INTO THE FIRST TURN. ÔHAT WAS ME. ÔHEN WATCH THE REPLAY OF THE SPIN IN TURN ONE, AND YOU WILL SEE ME JUST GETTING AROUND THE #17 CAR. É'M IN THE #93 CAR.×E'LL GET EM NEXT TIME.        ÍAURICE ÒANDALL                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: ÏUCH!!                           ÆÒÏÍ: ÇREGORYÄ12  06/14/93   Ó#: 474331  ÓOUNDS EXPENSIVE!
