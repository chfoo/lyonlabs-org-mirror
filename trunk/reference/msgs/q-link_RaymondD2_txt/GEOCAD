ÔHE ÇRAPHIC ENVIROMENT IS WHAT COMPUTERS WERE MENT TO EMBRACE AND THE LALATEST HYPERCARD IS STILL PROOF THAT COMPUTERS ARE EVOLVING.  ÇÅÏÃÁÄÄ 128 WOULD BE AN EXTENSION OF THE ÇEOÐAINT PROGRAM.  ÔHE ADDITIONAL SPEED, 80 COL. SCREEN AND ADDED DETAIL OF THE 128 SCREEN WOULD GIVE IT THE SUPERIOR EDGE OVER 64 BASED PRODUCTS.  ÐRESENTLY IN THE ÄENVER-ÃOLO. ÓPRINGS AREA DEALERS REPORT THAT 128Ä SALES ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH.  ÍAYBE YOU COULD USE THE NEW ÂASIC 8 LANGUAGE TO SUPPORT THE NEW GENERATION OF GRAPHICS FOR THE 128.  ÍANY COMPUTER SHOPS ARE OFFERING THE ÒÏÍ AND ÃÐÕ UPGRADES FOR THE 128 AT MORE THAN REASONABLE PRICES.  ÈOW ABOUT IT ÂRIAN, DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH THE EXPENSE OF NEW PRODUCT Ò&Ä?             (: ÃHEERS! :)
