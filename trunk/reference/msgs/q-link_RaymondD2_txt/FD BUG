субй: BIG фд BUG                       фром: мR мOOR     12/03/92   с#: 398746  OK WELL I WAS COPYING FILES LAST NIGHT AND I CAME ACROSS A REAL NICE фд BUG. YESTERDAY MORNING I CALLED цмд TO REPORT IT. I HAD FORMATTED SOME 1581 DISKS ABOUT A MONTH AGO SO I WOULDNT HAVE TO AT A COMPUTER PARTY I WAS GOING TO. I TEND NOT TO LABLE STUFF SO LAST NIGHT I CHECKED TO SEE IF THE DISKS WERE BLANK OR NOT. I WANTED TO PUT SOME STUFF ON AN ACTUAL 1581 DISK SO I COULD USE IT ON THE COMPUTER DOWNSTAIRS. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A 1581 FORMATTED DISK I DID AN '@$=P' PARTITION DIRECTORY. OF COURSE IT SAID '1581 DISK' SO I WENT AHEAD AND USED THE JIFFYDOS FILECOPIER TO COPY THE FILES TO THE фд. WHEN I WAS DONE I WENT TO CHECK THE DIR ON THE фд AND IT WAS TOTALLY SCRAMBLED. IT HAD PARTS OF THE PARTITION DIR IN IT. LATER I WAS GOING TO CLEAR A 1581 DISK OF SOME FILES BUT BEFORE I DID I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DISK WAS SOMEWHAT FULL. I DID THE '@$=P' AND THEN I SAVED A FILE TO THE фд. ит ате тхе вхоле дир анд спит алл ожер тхе бегининг оф тхе дир. THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LEAD TO THE BUG ARE...'@$=P' PARTITION DIRECTORY ANY WRITES TO THE DISK IMMEDIATELY AFTERWORDS SEEMS TO EAT THE DIR AND SPIT UP ON IT. TO AVOID THIS DO SOME OTHER DISK ACCESS AFTER A PARTITION DIRECTORY, SUCH AS..A NORMAL DIRECTORY, INITIALIZE THE DRIVE, LOAD A FILE, CHANGE/REMOVE THE DISK, ETC.I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH THAT THE DISK WAS EMPTY WHEN IT ORIGINALY HAPPENED. I HOPE THIS POST HELPS YOU NOT TO LOSE ANY FILES DUE TO THIS BUG. IF IT DOES, DONT DESPAIR, JUST E-MAIL ME. MOST FILES PROBABLY CAN BE RECOVERED WITH A SECTOR EDITOR.мR мOOR
