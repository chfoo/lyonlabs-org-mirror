ÆÒÏÍ: ÁRGO2       10/30/94   Ó#: 81634   ÉT HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN ON Ñ-LINK. É HAVE ONLY BEEN ON Ñ SINCE ÓEPTEMBER, 1992 BUT É HAVE EXPERIENCED BOTH THE HIGHS AND LOWS ON THIS SYSTEM. ÕNTIL THE EARLY PART OF 1993, Ñ-LINK WAS A VERY CREDIBLE NETWORK AS THE BOARDS WERE KEPT UP TO DATE AND THE WHOLE WORLD ONLY SEEMED AT OUR FINGERTIPS. ÈOWEVER, SINCE ABOUT ÁPRIL OF 1993 THINGS HAVE REALLY DETERIORATED ON HERE AS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RUN Ñ HAVE DONE THEIR BEST TO UNDERMINE THE NETWORK, THUS FORCING SUBSCRIBERS OFF AND JUSTIFYING THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THIS FINE NETWORK.    ÂUT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS OF Ñ-LINK, LET'S NOT DWELL ON THAT NEGATIVE STUFF. É HAVE MANY GREAT Ñ-FRIENDS AND Ñ-MEMORIES AND ALTHOUGH THE HEADS OF Ñ MAY BE ABLE TO SHUT Ñ-LINK ITSELF DOWN, THEY CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY OUR FRIENDSHIPS AND MEMORIES.   É WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY FELLOW Ñ-LINK SUBSCRIBERS FOR MAKING THIS A FUN, REWARDING AND VERY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME! É ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO GIVE ÂINGOÊERRY YOUR ADDRESSES SO THAT HE CAN PUT YOU ON HIS Ñ-NEWSLETTER MAILING LIST SO THAT WE CAN ALL KEEP IN TOUCH. É ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME ON BOTH ÇÅÎÉÅ AND ÄELPHI. É GO UNDER THE SCREEN NAME OF ÁRGO1 ON BOTH NETWORKS SO YOU WILL HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING ME. ÉT HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN FOLKS AND É ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!! ÙOU WILL ALL HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART!Ð.Ó. ÌET'S NOT GO OUT OF Ñ-LINK WITH A WHIMPER BUT WITH A ÂÁÎÇ!!!
