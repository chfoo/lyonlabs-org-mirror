ÂATTLE ÃHESSÉNTERPLAY - $34.99ÙET ANOTHER Ã-64/128 CONVERSION FROMTHE BIGGER MACHINES; BUT,SURPRISINGLY,THIS ONE MAINTAINS MUCHOF THE MAGIC THAT MADE IT SUCH A HITON THE ÁMIGA AND ÍÓ-ÄOS MACHINES.ÂATTLE ÃHESS IS THE SECOND RELEASEFROM ÉNTERPLAY SINCE THEY LEFTÅLECTRONIC ÁRTS LAST YEAR.ÔHE GRAPHICS ARE SUPRISINGLY GOOD;THE ONLY DIFFERENCE É CAN SEE FROMTHE ÁMIGA IS THAT THEY ARE SOMEWHATLESS COLORFUL AND HAVE A LOWERRESOLUTION. ÔHE ANIMATION, HOWEVER,IS PERHAPS THE BEST É HAVE SEEN ONTHE 64.ÁLTHOUGH IN SOME OF THE BATTLE SCENESIT IS HARD TO MAKE OUT WHAT ISHAPPENING, THE ANIMATION IS AMAZING(AND VERY FUNNY). ÔHE SOUND IS ALSOGOOD, WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS (PAWN VSPAWN,FOR EXAMPLE).ÔHE GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THATON THE ÁMIGA. ÙOU CAN EITHER PLAY THE3-Ä GAME WITH THE ANIMATION OR ACONVENTIONAL 2-Ä GAME IF YOU JUSTWANT TO PLAY NO-FRILLS CHESS. (ÙOUALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF PLAYING 3-ÄAND TURNING THE ANIMATION OFF). ÙOUCAN CHOOSE EITHER TO PLAY AGAINST THECOMPUTER, OR ANOTHER OPPONENT. ÙOUSELECT 6 DIFFICULTY LEVELS (WHENPLAYING AGAINST THE COMPUTER). ÂUTBEWARE IF YOU CHOOSE LEVEL 6; THECOMPUTER TAKES A ÌÏÎÇ TIME TO MAKEITS MOVE. ×HEN THAT HAPPENS, THEHANDY DANDY FORCE MOVE COMMAND WILLSPEED THINGS UP.ÂATTLE ÃHESS ALSO INCLUDES ANOTHERNICE FEATURE WHICH SUGGESTS WHAT MOVETO MAKE NEXT. ×HEN PLAYING AGAINSTTHE COMPUTER, IT'S ALSO FORGIVING INTHAT YOU CAN TAKE BACK YOUR LAST MOVEIF YOU SO DESIRE.ÏNE THING, HOWEVER, THAT É MUSTCOMPLAIN ABOUT, IS THE PACKAGING. ÏNTHE ÁMIGA AND ÍÓ-ÄOS VERSIONS YOU CANPLAY WITH AN OPPONENT ON ANOTHERCOMPUTER VIA THE MODEM. ÔHIS OPTIONIS ALSO ADVERTISED ON THE BACK OF THEBOX FOR THE 64 VERSION. ÈOWEVER, THE64 VERSION DOESN'T SUPPORT THISOPTION, WHICH IS STATED ONLY IN ÖÅÒÙSMALL PRINT ON THE VERSION LABEL.INDICATES WHICH VERSION IT IS.ÏNE OTHER MINUS TO THIS OTHERWISE FINEPROGRAM IS THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES ITIS A LITTLE BIT SLOW BUT NOT AS SLOWAS ONE MIGHT THINK (AND, NO, IT'S ÎÏÔÉT DOES INVOLVE SOME DISK ACCESS EACHTIME TWO PIECES BATTLE AND WHEN SOMEOF THEM MOVE.ÅVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAYCHESS YOU MAY WANT TO BUY ÂATTLEÃHESS. ÐLAYING OVER AND OVER, ANDUSING THE SUGGEST MOVE COMMAND, MAYHELP EFFECTIVELY TEACH YOU THEBASICS OF CHESS. ÍEANWHILE, THEEXCITING BATTLE SCENES WILL KEEPYOU INTERESTED WHILE YOU'RELEARNING.  <ÐÒÅÓÓ Æ7 & ÓÅÌÅÃÔ "ÇÅÔ ÎÅØÔ ÉÔÅÍ">                   -::-ÔHIS IS, ON THE WHOLE, A WELL-DONEPIECE OF SOFTWARE. ÉT'S NOT REALLYDISAPPOINTING, AS MANY OTHERCONVERSIONS FROM BIGGER TO SMALLERMACHINES HAVE BEEN. É'D SAY THAT THEPROGRAMMING TEAM AT ÉNTERPLAY THATDID THIS (ÍIKE ÑUARLES, ÊAY ÐATEL,AND ÔROY ×ORRELL) DESERVE TO BECOMMENDED, AS THEY DID AN EXCELLENTJOB AT CRAMMING A LOT OF INFO INTO ASMALL PLACE (1 WHOLE DISK). ÉN ANYEVENT, THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHINGYOU'LL WANT TO ADD TO YOUR SOFTWARECOLLECTION. ÒATING ***/****.ÓIR ÍIKE(ÍIKE ÅLMENDORF)          <ÐÒÅÓÓ Æ5 ÆÏÒ ÍÅÎÕ>
