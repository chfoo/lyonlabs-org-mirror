ÓÕÂÊ: É THINK É SPEAK....              ÆÒÏÍ: ÒOHAN2      09/28/94   Ó#: 404001  FOR ALL US ÓÉÄ ENTHUSIASTS WHEN É SAY THAT WE ALL OWE A TREMENDOUS DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO ÃRAIG ÃHAMBERLAIN, ÍARK ÄICKENSON, ÒOBERT ÓTOERRLE, AND ËENT ÓULLIVAN.  ÔHE COMBINED ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THESE FOUR CAPABLE AND CLEVER MEN HAVE ALLOWED US TO DERIVE A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE FROM WRITING, PLAYING, AND LISTENING TO ÓÉÄS.  É DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL MEMBERS OF Ñ-ÌINK, BUT IF ANYONE KNOWS OF A WAY WHERE WE CAN CONVEY OUR THANKS TO ANY OR ALL OF THESE MEN, É THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO DO SO BEFORE Ñ-ÌINK FOLDS FOR EVER.  ÁNY SUGGESTIONS?
