ÓÕÂÊ: ×ELL THAT WAS COMPLICATED  (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÇEOÒEP ÍË   08/18/89   Ó#: 844593  BUT É THINK THE ENDING WAS ALL THAT WAS IMPORTANT.  ÔHE ORIGINAL ÇEOÐAINT ISSUED WITH 2.0 HAS A BUG THAT IF YOU TRY TO DO ANYTHING IN PIXEL EDIT IN 40 COL. MODE THE SYSTEM WILL CRASH.  ÓEND THE DISK 2 BACK TO ÂÓ× AND IT WILL BE REPLACED FOR FREE WITH A DISK WITH THE BUG FIXED.
