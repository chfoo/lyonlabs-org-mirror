ÓÕÂÊ: ÓTEREO ÅDITOR                    ÆÒÏÍ: ÔOMÂ24      12/16/89   Ó#: 123614  ÅVERYBODY KNOWS BY NOW WHAT A FANTASTIC PROGRAM THIS IS.  ×E'RE STARTING TO SEE POSTS NOW ABOUT VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH TO ENHANCE IT'S USE THROUGH THE KEY CONFIG FEATURE TO SUIT INDIVIDUAL TASTES AND NEEDS. ÁLONG THOSE LINES É'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS EDITOR, HAS MADE THE CREATION OF THE BLUEGRASS FILES A WHOLE BUNCH EASIER FOR ME.ÊERRY ÒOTH (ÄR Ê5) ULED A LITTLE BASIC GEM SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ÃALLED ÃHORDBUSTER.  ÓINCE É BEGIN THESE SIDS WITH SHEETS CONTAINING ONLY THE MELODY LINE (ÖOICE 1) AND HAVE NO MUSICAL TALENT WHATEVER, É'VE FOUND IT INDISPENSABLE IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE OTHER 5 VOICES.  ÎOW WITH THE STEREO EDITOR É CAN HEAR THE RESULTS AND ADJUST ACCORDINGLY AND INSTANTANEOUSLY WHILE HEARING ALL SIX VOICES AT ONCE.  É'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND KEEPING A COPY OF ÃHORDBUSTER IN THE SAME BOX AS YOUR STEREO EDITOR IF YOU PLAN TO DO ANY ORIGINAL OR "BY EAR" SID PROGRAMMING. ÉT WORKS.ÔOM
