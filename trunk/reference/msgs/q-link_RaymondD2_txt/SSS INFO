FAX WOULD BE TOTALLY '¡'. AND HOW ABOUT INTEGRATING THE TASK SWITCHER INTO IT? MAYBE EVEN A BUILT IN Œœ “≈’ TASK SWITCH USING THE 128 64K VIDEO RAM AS STORAGE. AND THE CAPABILITY OF USING RAMLINK ƒ¡√√ INSTEAD OF AN ACTUAL “≈’. AND HOW ABOUT A PIC VIEWER FOR HI-RES OR MULTICOLOR. AND ON THE FAX, HOW ABOUT A 'SCREEN FAX' JUST TYPE IT ON THE SCREEN AND HIT THE BUTTON, SELECT 'FAX SCREEN' AND IT WILL FAX THE MESSAG OFF THE SCREEN. YOU KNOW ALOT OF FAX MACHINES ARE 200X200 DPI. IF YOU ROTATE THE SCREEN AND GIVE AN 8X8 MATRIX FOR EACH PIXEL IT WILL FIT PERFECT, YOU CAN EVEN DO GRAYSCALE BY ALTERING THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVE PIXELS IN THE 8X8 MATRIX ACCORDING TO THE INTENSITY OF THE COLOR. IT MIGHT EVEN BE A INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE TO A PRINTER. AND SPEAKING OF PRINTERS, HOW ABOUT A FEW MORE PRINTER TYPES, MAYBE EVEN LASERJET (PLEASE). OR YOU CAN MAKE AN INSTALLABLE PRINT DRIVER LIKE GEOS HAS AND USE A SMALL AREA OF CARTRIDGE RAM SO IT JUST CHECKS TO SEE IF ONE IS LOADED AND WILL DISPLAY IT WHEN YOU TOGGLE PRINTER TYPES. IS THAT ENOUGH IDEAS?
