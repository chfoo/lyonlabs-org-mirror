ÔHE TOP OF THE LIST IS THAT É DO ÓÉÄS :Ä AND É HAVE AN ENTHUSIASTIC INTEREST IN MUSIC OF ALL KINDS. É BEGAN ATTEMPTING ÓÉÄS ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE FIRST ÓÉÄ ÅDITOR WAS RELEASED. É HAD DOWNLOADED 4 MUSIC FILES FROM "ANOTHER NETWORK", LISTENED TO THEM ... GRIPPED THE KEYBOARD AND SHOUTED "É HAVE TO DO THIS!" É SPENT 3  DAYS TYPING IN THAT PROGRAM FROM THE BOOK AND NEVER DID GET IT DE-BUGGED EXACTLY. ÂUT É WAS ON MY WAY. ÅXCEPT É KNEW ÎÏÔÈÉÎÇ ABOUT MUSIC. É DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A 'REST' WAS ... COULDN'T FIND A CORRESPONDING NOTE ON THE KEYBOARD, SO É LEFT THEM OUT :Ä ÂUT É WORKED AT IT, BUYING MUSIC THEORY BOOKS, READING EVERYTHING É COULD GET. É LISTENED INTENTLY TO MUSIC AND BECAME FAMILIAR WITH HOW THE SOUNDS WERE DEVELOPED ... THE SUBTLIES OF THEIR TONES. É'M TELLING YOU THIS SO YOU'LL UNDERSTAND ... ÁÎÙÏÎÅ CAN USE THE ÓÉÄ ÅDITOR. ÉT TAKES NO SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL. ÉT'S A FORM OF ART FOR ALL. ×ELL, AFTER THREE YEARS OF THIS É CAN NOW SPOT READ MUSIC; É CAN LOOK AT SHEET MUSIC AND "HEAR" THE WAY É WANT IT TO BE, IMMEDIATELY SPOT PROBLEM AREAS AND HOW TO OVERCOME THOSE PASSAGES. ÁLL OF THIS BECAUSE É DOWNLOADED 4 MUSIC FILES A LONG TIME AGO. :) ÙÏÕ CAN DO IT, TOO!
