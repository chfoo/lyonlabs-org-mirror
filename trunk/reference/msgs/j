ÁLSO, ANYONE WHO MAKES A BIG DEAL OUT OF HIS RACIAL BACKGROUND IS, QUITE SIMPLY, MISSING THE POINT. ÔHE POINT IS ILLUSTRATED BEST AT ÁCTS 10:34 & 35 WHICH READS FROM THE ÁMPLIFIED ÂIBLE "ÁND ÐETER OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SAID:'ÍOST CERTAINLY AND THOROUGHLY É NOW PERCEIVE AND UNDERSTAND THAT ÇOD SHOWS NO PARTIALITY AND IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS,(35)ÂUT IN EVERY NATION HE WHO VENERATES AND HAS A REVERENTIAL FEAR FOR ÇOD, TREATING ÈIM WITH WORSHIPFUL OBEDIENCE AND LIVING UPRIGHTLY, IS ACCEPTABLE TO ÈIM AND SURE OF BEING RECEIVED AND WELCOMED BY ÈIM.'".
