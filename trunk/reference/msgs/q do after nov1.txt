SUBJ: what to do after nov 1           FROM: Brenda g4   10/25/94   S#: 79527   
Well, JohnD39 and I discussed it a little bit tonight.

We will first need to go through what we have. (For example, I have ### files with the descriptions.) Remember, do not delete the .SDAs etc.

Then we will decide what to do. The reason for this is, we do not know if we will have 60, 600, or even 6,000 disks. So we do not know how to handle the copies etc.

I will somehow get a survey to you to show what we need to know about your disks. (Via JohnD39, Jerry, etc)

Personally, I'd rather not see the files be uploaded everywhere until the dl helpers get them somewhat organized.
The reason is that it will cause confusion.

(If you're reading this and you just WANT the files... please be patient. We are going to have a ton of stuff to go through.)
