ÉS Ñ DESTINED TO GO OUT WITH A WHIMPER RATHER THAN A BANG? ÔHANKS TO ALL ÇÅÏÓ USERS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED MY ÆONT ÒESOURCE ÄIRECTORY. É'LL SEE SOME OF YOU ON OTHER SYSTEMS SOON...PROBABLY WILL TRY ÇÅNIE AFTER THE NEW YEAR STARTS.ÄOES ANYONE HAVE AN ADDRESS FOR ÊOSEPH ÔHOMAS, CREATOR OF ÒESCUE 128/64?  Á LETTER AND SHAREWARE CHECK CAME BACK FROM THE ADDRESS PROVIDED WITH THE PROGRAM.                     -::-ÓÕÂÊ: ÂYE ÄICKEE,                (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÓKI CRAZY   10/26/94   Ó#: 79858   ÓEE YOU ON ÇÅNIE IF YOU HAPPEN TO LOG ON THERE.  ÆIND A TERM YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, AND YOUR JOURNEY WILL BE MORE ENJOYABLE.  ÔHERE IS A LOT HAPPENING OVER THERE.  ÏNE IS THE FORMAL CONFERENCE FORMAT WITH SUCH GUESTS AS ÊIM ÂUTTERFIELD, ÄAVE ÆERGUSON, ÓUSAN ÌAMB, ÔOM ÎETSEL, ÍAURICE ÒANDALL, ÄOUG ÃOTTON, ÍARK ÆELLOWS, ÂRIAN ÃROSWAITE, ÎICK ÒOSSI, ÊIM ÃOLLETTE, AND MORE.      ÍANY OF THE ÃOMMODORE SUPPORT COMPANIES SUCH AS ÃÍÄ, ÐARSEC, ÃOLOR64,AND É'M  PROBABLY FORGETTING SOME HAVE MADE THEIR ONLINE HOME THERE.   ÐROGRAMMERS SUCH AS ÍAURICE ÒANDALL, Å.Ç.ÂELL, ÓTEVE ÅYRSE, ÎICK ÒOSSI, AND ÒICK ÃOLEMAN ARE FREQUENTLY FOUND ONLINE.  ÍAGAZINES LIKE ÃOMMODORE ×ORLD, ÒANDOM, ÇAZETTE, ÕNDERGROUND, AND DIEÈARD HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED THROUGH THE YEAR.   ×RITERS SUCH AS ÓTEVE ÖANDERÁRK, ÇAELYNE ÍORANEC, ÓCOTT ÅGGLESTON, ÄOUG ÃOTTON (HE DOES EVERYTHING, DOESN'Ô HE?) ÓHERRY ÆREEDLINE, AND OF COURSE, ÌES ÓONGA ARE FOUND IN THE ÒEAL ÔIME ÃONFERENCE AREAS.   ÉT IS FUN RUBBING ELBOWS WITH USERS THAT USE THE OTHER PLATFORMS (ÁPPLE,ÍESSY ÄOS, ÍACS, ÁTARI, ETC) IN THE CHAT AREAS.   ÎOW IF THEY COULD JUST SHORTEN THE LEARNING CURVE.  ÈOWEVER, ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT,YOU'LL APPRECIATE THE 2400, UP TO 9600 ACCESS.  ÔHE ABILITY TO SAVE LARGER AMOUNTS OF MESSAGES AND READ THEM OFF LINE (SAVE MONEY).  ÔHE LARGE AMOUNTS OF CONTROL YOU HAVE WHILE YOU ARE ON.      ÂUT OF COURSE, THERE WILL NEVER BE QUITE THE SAME FEELING AS WE ALL HAVE HAD ON ÑLINK.  ÂUT É GUESS THE TIME FOR CHANGE IS HERE, AND WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE WE COULD ALL FIND IT ISN'Ô SO BAD AFTER ALL.   :) -ÔIM                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: .                          (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRENDA G4   10/27/94   Ó#: 80453   WELLLLL...É AM ON ÇÅNIE AND É DON'T LIKE IT. ÔHE STUFF ÔIM SAID IS TRUE THOUGH.ÔHE Ã= CHAT ROOMS ARE NOT VERY FRIENDLY. ÔHEY MIGHT MAKE A SLIGHT COMMENT ON WHAT YOU SAY, BUT THEN THEY JUST GO BACK TO WHATEVER CONVERSATION IS GOING ON AT THE TIME. ÔHIS DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN, BUT IT HAS HAPPENED TOO MANY TIMES TO ME. ÉT SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY CANNOT HANDLE MORE THAN ONE CONVERSATION AT A TIME. É ONCE WENT IN TO ASK A QUESTION OF ÊÂÅÅ. (ÊÂÅÅ RUNS THE WHOLE Ã= AREA.) ÈE TOLD ME TO WAIT, HE WAS IN A PRIVATE ROOM. É WAITED. ÁND WAITED. ÂUILDING UP $$$ ON MY BILL. ÉT TOOK HIM 20 MINUTES TO GET TO ME. É HAVE ÎÅÖÅÒ BEEN TREATED LIKE THIS ON Ñ-ÌINK. ÔHE ATTITUDE ON ÇÅNIE IS, É AM TALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE RIGHT NOW, AND THAT IS MORE INTERESTING AND/OR MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU. ÏR, É DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IMMEDIATELY, ITS TOO HARD... THINK É'LL JUST CONTINUE THE OTHER CONVERSATION. ÏF COURSE, É HAVE HAD PEOPLE HELP ME TOO. ÂUT BASICALLY THE Ã= AREA IS RUDE AND OFFENSIVE TO ME. É THINK IT MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT HANDLE MORE THAN ONE CONVERSATION AT ONCE. É REMEMBER WHEN É WAS TRAINED TO BE A HOST ON Ñ-ÌINK. ÙOU WERE ÅØÐÅÃÔÅÄ TO BE ABLE TO HOLD DOWN SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AT ONCE, AND GIVEN TIPS TO DO SO.É NEVER FEEL WELCOME IN THE HELP ROOM. É FEEL LIKE É AM INTRUDING ON SOMEONE ELSE. (ÅXCEPT WHEN É AM THERE TALKING TO SOMEONE LIKE ÃÍÄ-ÄÏÕÇ ;) )ÔHE MESSAGE BOARDS ARE FINE. ÅXCEPT ONE THING... THEY WANT YOU TO POST ON THE END OF HUGE POSTS. ÔHEY SAY YOU MAY START YOUR OWN POSTS, BUT IN PRACTICE IT IS DISCOURAGED. ÆOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ÒÁÍÌINK, YOU DO NOT START YOUR OWN POST. ÙOU ÒÅÓÐÏÎÄ TO A GENERIC "ÒÁÍÌINK" POST. ÓOMETIMES THESE POSTS HAVE ÈÕÎÄÒÅÄÓ OF RESPONSES. ÓO IF YOU HAVE A DISK DRIVE PROBLEM, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO READ THROUGH 500 RESPONSES TO SEE IF YOUR QUESTION WAS COVERED.ÙES, IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO BUFFER ALL THE MESSAGES, BUT É HAVE STILL NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IGNORE AREAS É AM NOT INTERESTED IN. ÔHEY ALWAYS "COME BACK". ÔHE LEARNING CURVE COMMENT IS VERY TRUE... É CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A VERY EXPERIENCED USER. É THINK IT HAS ×ÁÙ TOO STEEP OF A LEARNING CURVE. ÉT OPERATES DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER ÂÂÓ É HAVE BEEN ON. (ÔHAT MAINLY REFERS TO THE MESSAGE BASE.) ÔO Ñ USER THAT HAS NEVER CALLED ANOTHER ÂÂÓ IN THEIR LIFE, THEY WILL RUN SCREAMING FROM ÇÅNIE.CONTINUED..                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: .                          (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRENDA G4   10/27/94   Ó#: 80500   ÏN THAT COMMENT WHERE É SAID YOU WOULD HAVE TO READ THROUGH 500 MESSAGES TO SEE IF YOUR QUESTION WAS ANSWERED... WHAT É MEANT WAS IF YOU WANTED TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, YOU WOULD HAVE TO READ THROUGH 500 RESPONSES. ÉF YOU POSTED 501, YOU COULD JUST READ THE NEW MESSAGES TO SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ANSWERED. ÂUT É LIKE TO SEE IF MY Ñ HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED BEFORE É ASK IT. ÏN Ñ-ÌINK, YOU JUST PAGED THROUGH THE MENUS. ÏN ÇÅNIE, YOU GET POSTS LIKE THIS:1571 DISK DRIVE PROBLEMSTHIS IS A POST FOR 1571 DISK DRIVE PROBLEMS500 RESPONSES(ÔHIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE, DON'T KNOW IF THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THERE.)ÔO SEE IF YOUR QUESTION WAS ALREADY ASKED, YOU GET TO READ 500 MESSAGES. É WOULD RATHER SEE IT LIKE IT IS ON Ñ-ÌINK... ×HEN É HAD 3 1571S WITH 3 DIFFERENT PROBLEMS, É POSTED THEM ALL SEPARATELY SO THEY WOULDN'T BE CONFUSED. ÔHEY TELL YOU IT IS OK TO START YOUR OWN POSTS, BUT IF YOU DO THEY DISCOURAGE YOU FROM DOING IT AGAIN. É THINK THE MESSAGE AREAS CAN ONLY HOLD A CERTAIN # OF POSTS. ÉF PEOPLE POST ALL THE TIME THE SYSOP HAS MORE WORK. ÔHEREFORE, "RESPOND, DON'T POST". É COULD BE WRONG BUT THAT IS WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE.ÔHE SOFTWARE LIBRARIES ÁÒÅ ÎÏÔ A REPLACEMENT FOR Ñ-ÌINK. ÔHE REASON IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY RESTRICTIONS. É FOUND THIS OUT WHEN É TRIED TO ENTER THE UPLOADING CONTEST. (ÓHOULD HAVE BEEN ÄÏ×ÎÌÏÁÄÉÎÇ FROM Ñ :( ) ÓOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS ARE: NO ÐÅÔÓÃÉÉ TEXT FILES - THEY MUST BE TRUE ÁÓÃÉÉ (MANY ÃOMMODORE USERS CAN'T HANDLE THESE), NO OLD VERSIONS OF FILES, ONLY CERTAIN ARCHIVES ARE ALLOWED - THINK IT IS .SDA AND .SFX, NO Ñ-ÌINK TEXT FILES, AND ONLY "ÐÄ" SIDS - BASICALLY THIS MEANS CLASSICAL ONLY. É HAD TO BABY THE PERSON RELEASING MY FILES... SHE COULDN'T GET PART OF THEM TO WORK WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM. ÏF COURSE, SHE WOULD JUST SAY "FILENAME XX DOES NOT WORK" AND É WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN IN GREAT DETAIL HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. ÏNE EXAMPLE WAS A MUSIC PROGRAM. ÓHE SAID IT DIDN'T WORK. É SAID, LOAD THE PROGRAM, THE LOAD A SONG TO PLAY, THEN SELECT PLAY. ÄON'T KNOW IF SHE EVER GOT IT TO WORK.ÂUT THE WORST PART OF ALL IS THE PERSON THAT RUNS IT, ÊÂÅÅ. ÈE RUNS IT LIKE A DICTATOR. É HAVE HEARD LOTS OF BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM. ÏNE OF THEM WAS... IF YOU POST A MESSAGE ASKING PEOPLE TO SEND YOU A STAMP FOR YOUR LIST OF WHATEVER, HE DELETES THE MESSAGE AND TELLS YOU TO ÕÐÌÏÁÄ THE LIST. ÊÂÅÅ GETS ÐÁÉÄ FOR EACH DOWNLOAD. ÈMM.WOW PART 3..                    -::-ÓÕÂÊ: PART 3                     (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÂRENDA G4   10/27/94   Ó#: 80517   ÉT SEEMS THE FARTHER YOU GET AWAY FROM THE Ã= AREAS, THE BETTER ÇÅNIE IS. ÉT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPUTER USERS AND THE WIDE VARIETY OF INTERESTS. ×HEN É WENT IN ONE OF THESE CHAT ROOMS, É FORGET WHICH ONE IT WAS... THE PEOPLE WERE TRIPPING OVER THEMSELVES TO HELP ME. É THINK THERE WERE 3 PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP ME AT ONE TIME.ÓO ANYWAY... É GUESS É WILL CLOSE BY SAYING, ÇÅNIE AIN'T NO Ñ-ÌINK.É PLAN TO CHECK OUT ÐHOENIX AND/OR ÄELPHI.                       -::-ÓÕÂÊ: É DIDN'T FIND...           (Ò)   ÆÒÏÍ: ÓKI CRAZY   10/29/94   Ó#: 81254   THE SAME PROBLEMS ÂRENDA FOUND.  É HAD NEVER USED A BBS BEFORE AND É DIDN'T FIND IT THAT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE.  ÉF YOU USE THE HELPS IN THE ÂULLITIN BOARD YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF GETTING THROUGH MESSAGES FASTER.  ÁS FAR AS 500 RESPONSES, THE STAFF TAKES THE MESSAGE THREAD AND ARCS IT INTO AN EASILY DOWNLOADABLE FILE WHEN THE THREAD GETS TOO BIG...ÁND THIS IS FAR EARLIER THAN 500 RESPONSES QUOTE.  É NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH FRIENDLINESS, BUT É SUPPOSE IF ONE DOES THERE ARE AVENUES TO TAKE TO BRING IT TO THE HOSTS ATTENTION.  ×HEN É RAN INTO THAT PROBLEM ON ÑLINK É KNOW THAT É DID.  ÍOST OF THE THINGS É BROUGHT OUT IN THE FIRST MESSAGE THREAD, AND OTHERS WERE THINGS THAT HELPED ME DECIDE TO BECOME A HOST ON ÇÅNIE.  É HOPE ANY OF YOU FOLKS WHEN YOU LOG ON, IF  É AM EVER GUILTY OF ANY OF THE PREVIOUS WRITER'S COMPAINTS WILL LET ME KNOW.  É CERTAINLY TRY TO BE HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY, AND É KNOW THE REST OF  THE STAFF DOES IN THE ÃOMMODORE AREA.   É'M REALLY SORRY YOU HAD THOSE PROBLEM AND FEEL THIS WAY.
