SUBJ: important! contact list          FROM: Brenda g4   10/15/94   S#: 75673   
What y'all have been waiting for... (would have posted sooner except for I have this habit of sleeping for a couple hours a day ;) )

Please send your Internet Address to JohnD39. Note that it is for the dl project. John is also doing the main Internet address list. Even if you have already mailed him for that, please mail him again to let him know you are interested in the dl project. Also mail him even if you have emailed me.

This will get you a survey and maybe other goodies. 

(Note that you might have an Internet Address even if you don't think you do. I didn't know I had one until I saw my name on John's list! (b.gann1@genie.geis.com) I guess if you are on a network that supports Internet, you automatically have an Internet address.

If you ONLY have a US Mail address, please send it to Bingo Jerry. (Ask for the first issue of Q-Orphanette, but also specify your interest in the dl project.) Hope this is ok, I haven't asked Jerry yet. (You only need to contact John or Jerry, not both.)
