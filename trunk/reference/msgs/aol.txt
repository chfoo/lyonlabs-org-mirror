SUBJ: AOL MUST DIE!!             (R4)  FROM: Centipede   08/02/94   S#: 397791  
 As i'm sure you've read, Q-Link is
 gone at the end of October.

 They say they can no longer afford to
 keep the system working.  Maybe they 
 could if they spent a little more time
 and money on Q.  Instead they spend
 all their resources on AOL.  They 
 would probably say the money problem
 is because of declining membership on
 Q.  Maybe if they had fixed things
 instead of letting half, or more, of 
 the system fall apart, users wouldn't
 have left.

 They give the demise of Commodore as
 another reason for Q being
 discontinued.  I say there are still
 plenty of C64/128 users out there who
 could've kept Q going is things were
 fixed.  I subscribe to Loadstar, a
 disk magazine for the 64/128.  I
 haven't heard anything from them about
 going out of business because
 Commodore did.  I think a major 
 reason is because they keep improving
 their product.  On the other hand, 
 Steve Case & the people who run AOL &
 Q have done nothing to make Q better.
 They haven't even done anything to 
 keep what already existed working.

 My favorite part of the news about Q's
 demise is the part about going over
 to AOL.  Why don't they just come out
 & say...Come over to AOL where you'll
 be screwed just like you've been on
 Q!!

My favorite part of Steve Case's "Dear Members" letter was where he acknowledged that many of us may have "noticed a diminished level of product quality in the last few months"!  He must have written the letter two years ago and just now figured out how to post it.

 Yo AOL fools. I may be a crazed crippled 'nam vet. But I think that if GEnie can run stuff for 64/128.  Then Q-Link can be maintained. I have owned my 64 for a year and a half. Been on Q-Link less than 9 months and you are ripping it away. Fine, now you want me to join AOL. Great, but you won't/don't support Commodore. GEnie does. Are they better than you?  I want the files that you have for the 64 and the 128. So don't just erase them, pass them along to someone who will upload them to other boards. GEnie for one and our local Circuit Net node. Hell I am saving up for hard drives from CMD. Send them to me and I'll put them on my upcoming board. If you want me on AOL. Then you have two choices. <A> support commodore or <B> ISSUE ME THE COMPUTER OF YOUR CHOICE THAT  LOGS ON YOUR AOL!!!. 'Cause man I don't think the lord god shines out of I.B.M.'s rectum!! DIG man! Keep Q-Link Loadstar is doing fine, CMD is doing fine, the asian and euro markets are doing fine.
Hey how much is I.B.M. paying you to do this to commodore people?

It is rumored that this was once a marvel to behold.  Slick, new and powerful, a true wonder of the computer age.  Ha!

Qlink is now only a husk of it's former self.  Mind numbingly slow, graphicly inferior and needlessly limited Qlink makes the C64/128 act as old as it is.

It need not be so!  The C64/128 can still do some cool stuff.  Anyone who owns a CMD product can attest to that.  This little computer deserves better treatment than it gets on Qlink.  The premier network for the Commodore??! My arse!  Any, and I mean any other on line service beats Qlink hands down.

Come on people! It's time to let the puppy give up the ghost.  Qlink is dead, long live the C64/128!!!

   everyone who has a Commie stays faithful to QLink as well as their Commie itself. While it's true QLink may not be what it once was, and it should be repaired to it's former self, it is still a host of friends doing what they've been doing for years. enjoying each other's company!

SUBJ: I'm inclined to agree...   (R)   FROM: Motherwort  07/14/94   S#: 395979  
with Avamon.  I've just recently returned to Q-Link after a couple of years away and I have to say I'm quite disappointed.  However, perhaps it would be better to offer suggestions as to ways to improve instead of condemning all of Q-Link.

Let's hear some suggestions, folks!?!

SUBJ: Alternatives                     FROM: Axe king    07/17/94   S#: 766089  
There are other systems out there.....
          Genie and Compuserve

The nose pickers that run this system also run the America Online service.  They saw that they could make more money off of the ms-dos machines.  So they cast us off to drift.  Gee...I wonder how they made all of the money to start America Online?  America Online uses software that is like the Q-link software...you can't get on-line unless you have an ms-dos machine and the software.  I wonder how much money they could make if they let other users in like Genie and Compuserve do......

I just received a letter today from Steve Case of America OnLine offering to transfer my lifetime membership from QLink to AOL and stating that it entitles me to FIVE FREE hours each month for use anywhere online.  Does anyone know if the regular monthly AOL membership fee includes FIVE FREE hours or just ONE as on QLink?

Also, the telephone number given in the letter to call to transfer membership is the same as the one listed here on QLink except that the area code is (7O3) instead of a free (8OO) number.  Has anyone tried yet to make this phone call?

You get 5 hours each month with your
monthly fee.

As for the phone #, don't know. Just
try it. They prolly took away the 800
number to further screw those who need
customer service help. Since their
CS reps never know what you're talking
about and have never heard of whatever
problem it is you're trying to explain,
the inbound 800 number (which still
charges by usage) was prolly costing
them too much. This way you get to
pay for their ineptitude!!
