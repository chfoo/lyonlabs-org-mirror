ÔHIS IS TRANSPORTABLE ENOUGH. ÍY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE FILES ARE GOING TO BE PURGED AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. ÉF THEY CAN BE DUMPED ONTO A TAPE, THEN ALL IS NOT LOST. ÍY FIRST IDEA WAS THAT ÁMERICAN ÏNLINE COULD PROVIDE THE TAPE TO ×ALNUT ÃREEK ÃÄÒÏÍ AND THEY COULD PUBLISH THE ARCHIVE, THUS MAKING A PROFIT FOR BOTH THEM AND ÁÏÌ. ÁS AN ALTERNATIVE IDEA, É COULD ATTEMPT TO BUY THE ARCHIVE TAPE.ÍY BIG CONCERN IS THAT THIS ARCHIVE SHOULD NOT BE LOST. ÔHIS IS *ÔÈÅ* LARGEST ARCHIVE OF ÃOMMODORE PROGRAMS AND FILES IN THE WORLD. ÔHIS LOSS WOULD BE A SEVERE BLOW TO THE COMPUTING COMMUNITY, AS THERE ARE SHINING EXAMPLES OF TRUE 8-BIT CODING BRILLIANCE.É UNDERSTAND THAT ÁÏÌ'S COMPUTER RESOURCES ARE BEING CONSUMED BY THE "RISEING TIDE...", BUT É KNOW OF VERY FEW COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT DON'T HAVE SOME WAY TO BACK-UP THE SYSTEM. ÔHIS ALONE MIGHT BE A WORKABLE SOLUTION. ÐERHAPS É COULD PURCHASE THAT "LAST SYSTEM BACKUP" TAPE.
