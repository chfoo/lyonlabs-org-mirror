SUBJ: Jesus was not white!       (R13) FROM: Brock Lan   01/26/94   S#: 480835  
Contrary to many beiliefs, many people think that jesus was a white man when he, indeed was a black man. In the bible it says he had hair of wool and feet of soot. ANd you consider the geographical location, no white man could have survived under those circumstances.

Did any one on this board say he was? I know I didn't and any one that said he was is ignorant of the racial make up of the region he was born and raised up in. Also, anyone who makes a big deal out of his racial background is, quite simply, missing the point. The point is illustrated best at Acts 10:34 & 35 which reads from the Amplified Bible "And Peter opened his mouth and said:'Most certainly and thoroughly I now perceive and understand that God shows no partiality and is no respecter of persons,(35)But in every nation he who venerates and has a reverential fear for God, treating Him with worshipful obedience and living uprightly, is acceptable to Him and sure of being received and welcomed by Him.'". Now if you or any one else has a problem with the Amplified Bible I can quote from the New English Bible, the Modern Language Bible, the Jerusalem Bible, the Living Bible, the New American Standard Bible, the Revised Standard Bible, the New World Translation, or any number of other translations, and, oh yes, lest I forget, the King James Version as well.

But it is an insult and a disgrace to see him displayed as being a white man. It shouldn't matter of what origin that he was, however,  unfortunately this society operates  on image and being that it is of an evil and cruel nature, this is one thing, among many things that has been discredited among African Americans.

will make jesus out to be what is ideal for them...whites may see him as white, blacks as black...(but i still say he is neither)(and im white, btw)but, does it really matter? in the end, all that matters is that He is God, and in heaven, the color of the body, nor the body itself, count as anything...all that matters is the soul

Well steve, how do you explain the passage that says, "he had hair of wool and feet of soot."? How do  you explain how anyone white could survive in that area? And in case you didn't know, steve, THERE ARE BLACK JEWS! Yes! News flash! There are.

Sorry, my statement that Jews are white was incorrect. I was misinformed by someone in the room at the time. Jews are their own race. 
 As to explaining the verse you mentioned I would have to so some study on that.

You are all off by a long shot! Jesus was of an olive skin tone, like the Hispanics. Look at your map! Wooly hair, that's curly. If you don't have a map, watch the news on TV. They go to
the Holy Land from time to time, and even show people!

SUBJ: Color, race, How about red?(R)   FROM: Nitengale1  04/02/94   S#: 761122  
     As a nurse of nearly 2 decades, I wish to assure everyone that be it white, black, or olive,  the color of the blood is red. (barring respiratory distress or metabolic imbalances) I also am unconcerned as to color as long as ther is plenty of light coming from the Great Physician when I go to meet him.  I will be inttellectually honest enough to vote for olive skin and dark curly hair.

Obviously any one who has not read the Bible would say that Jesus was not white.As if Jesus color matters.The races where divided at the tower of Babel.The unrightchous were made to have darker skin. Not to say that any race is better than another.But BrockLan,,Get off the im a poor black man soap box. We are all created equal.

Thankyou,Brocklan for you ideas on the subject of the color of Jesus.I have talked to my  clergyman and done some
reserch.Have you ever heard of the shroud of Terin?? Jesus looked kind of spanish there.Not to burst your bubble but in a land where all the people were small and dark skinned.Wouldnt Jesus really stand out if he were taller and white?Have you ever been to Mexico?? Those dark skinned people are mostly blonde. You need to do some more reserch..

I have read the bible, in many translations, and have found several sources that lead me to believe that, indeed, the Christ may have been of African descent. The book of Revelation , the story of Samson, the story of John the Baptist, but it does not really matter, if one believes that the LIving GOD came to this Earth as  Jesus, Son of Joseph and Mary(of course concieved by the Holy Spirit), was betrayed, died upon a Roman crucifix and rose from the dead to proclaim the salvation of man, everlasting life!! A tract that explains additional views is  entitled " the search for a Black Savior," by Wm. L. Banks.
