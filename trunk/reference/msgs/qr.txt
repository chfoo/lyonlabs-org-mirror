SUBJ: QLink rumor.               (R8)  FROM: JeanN1      07/16/94   S#: 766051  
It seems that over time, the stories of the demise of QLink have been greatly
exaggerated. However, I got a rumor 
that sounds rather authentic, that August 31st is the really truly end.
Maybe anybody who wants to download wha is still available ought to consider it is possibly true. We will see if this gets censored. If it gets censored, then I know it is probably true.

I had heard that they were supposed to connect QLink with AOL and that in People Connection you could actually talk to people on AOL.  The last time I was playing Blackjack in the Casino, there were at least three people there. One of them mentioned using a PC.  This led me to beleive that they were not on QLink.  I did not join in on the conversation.

That's quite a rumor. And it is possible it has already happened? I 
wonder if they really did plan to do that, if that would mean everybody who signs up for QLink would get complete AOL coverage including Internet? Hmm.
Nice to think about, anyway.

I had read once that AOL was growing so rapidly that they couldn't accomodate all of the new customers and that sometimes customers had to wait to log on to the service.  That could account for some of the problems we have here on QLink too.  Anyway your advice to finnish up your downloading sounds like good advice since QLink is slowly deteriating.  I used to get dropped off-line only in basic services.  Now it happens in plus time as well.

SUBJ: PC users in People Connecti(R)   FROM: Phritz1     07/28/94   S#: 396715  
I don't think those PC users in People Connection were from America Online and/or using their IBMs/Clones.

Don't forget, PC (Personal Computer) fully applies to our Commodores, too!

SUBJ: It's right!!!              (R)   FROM: Katydid     07/29/94   S#: 396857  
   Had to call to get a new # to sine on becuase left super Q wrong :Ü To get the # was 45 min. But they said as of 8-1-94 no one new will come on to Q-link and at the end of this year Q-link will be no more. This info is right from the Q-link servic # 1-800-827-8444. No one even knows about Q-link there. That is why is was 45 min. just to get the # I needed to get back on Q-link. Got to use all that free + time I have left.

I ID'd several of the names from the Casino and they "are not valid QLink names".
