HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, AND ALL OF THEM HAVE MERIT. É HAVEN'T SEEN TOO MUCH POSTING ANSWERING ANY OF THEM, BUT PERHAPS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EMAIL ABOUT IT.É JUST LOGGED IN TO THIS SECTION AND AM STIMULATED TO ADD MY EFFORTS IN ANY CONSTRUCTIVE WAY, FROM INVOLVEMENT WITH ÂRENDA Ç4 TO PETITIONING ÑÃÓ FOR TERMS REGARDING OBTAINING THEIR FULL 64/128 LIBRARIES, SUCH AS THEY ARE.É URGE EACH OF YOU TO GET INVOLVED, AS THREE MONTHS OF DOWNLOADING (15  HOURS, UNLESS YOU CAN GET YOUR CLUB TO JUSTIFY THE $4.80/HR EXTRA, OR PAY FOR IT YOURSELF!) IS NOT GONNA DO IT. ÓO AN HOUR OR TWO OF NETWORKING ONLINE, COUPLED WITH A FEW LETTERS AND A LOT OF COPYING AND SWAPPING COULD NET EACH OF US A LOT MORE THAN WE COULD GET IN THOSE 15 HOURS.×HADDAYA SAY?ÐOST HERE FOR ALL TO SEE.
