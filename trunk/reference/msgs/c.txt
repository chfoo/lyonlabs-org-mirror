When Jesus returns, he is really going to be PEEVED  when he sees the amount of so-called christians who make a fool of him. Also, the man was BLACK! American society wants you to believe that he was a white guy. Some may argue that it dosen't matter what color he was.. But if you think that way, then you, too, have accepted the idea that he was not a black man. The Bible said he had hair of wool and feet of soot.. Nothing else could be meant by that.

Brock, I see you are caught up in what race Jesus was. As the Bible points out, he was Jewish. His mother was Jewish, as was his step-father, Joseph (His father being God). This means he was a semite or a decendant of Shem a son of Noah. Since all semites are dark, it stands to reason that Jesus was also. Jesus' message was directed to his fellow jews. It was only later, after the majority of the jewish people rejected this message that it was presented to the gentile nations by direction of a resurrected Jesus in a dream to Peter. The fact is, it would not matter what pigmentation his skln was, that's immaterial, what is important is the message he brought, the things he did to add weight to his words, and the perfect life he gave in order to ransom us all. These are the things that made him the greatest man who ever lived.

It does matter what color he is portrayed! If we accept an inaccurately white, British Jesus we further the notion that God is white!  We REALLY do!  Also, I consider it less than a coincidence that the Lord should be of a race oppressed since his time.

since God is not a "person" a we know the word, i do not think it is fair to label Him as a color. God is everycolor and everything to all people! (to me, God is a translucent spirit with a beard)   :)

   Yellow, brown, black and white they are precious in His sight, Jesus loves all the children of the world.

Yeah.. you can say I bent on color, chester..  I am indeed. It is for the simple fact that anything related to a contibution by an African American has been discredited in this society.
