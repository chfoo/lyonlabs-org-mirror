SUBJ: 1764 RAM EXPANSION         (R1)  FROM: R2D7        05/02/91   S#: 846636  
I recently purchased Geos for the 128 and I also have two 1541 DD as well as a 1764 REU (256 ram).  When I configure my system, I find that, when in Desktop, the Desktop screen says I only have 165K RAM available on the REU after I 'activate' it.  Is this true or am I doing something wrong?   I also thought (or maybe read) that all three memory devices, i.e. the two drives and the REU were equally accessable without swapping them around (if you know what I mean) or am I mistaken.  Thanx for any help. R2
