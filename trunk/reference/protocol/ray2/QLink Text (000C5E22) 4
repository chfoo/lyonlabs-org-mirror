SUBJ: A great printer driver idea..    FROM: TPUGMAIL    04/30/91   S#: 810530  
  back up a wee bit and have a look at   a message I wrote under,
    Customer Service,
      New Products and Sugestions,
 with the same header as this. I'm a     very slow typist and do not want to     re type it.. 
 
 It has to do with the REDUCED drivers   and an "OFFSET" driver to print a real   geoMAG on the wide caridge printers    AND very easy to do!
 
<<sheesh, this place has alot 'O          message bases.. I've been up here       some months now and never realized!>>
 
 Get the idea of kicking a page over     roughly 7 inches and with it reduced,   on a 14"wide by 8"high paper!!
  You could print the second page on a   second pass through the printer..
 
 Go read the other message, its great!
 
   realy..           }>ug..
