 READING ELECTRONIC MAIL

 If you see the word "MAIL" in the
 lower right-hand corner of your
 screen, you have Electronic Mail
 (E-Mail) waiting for you.

 To read your waiting E-Mail, you need
 to go to the "Q-Link Post Office."
 You will find a Post Office on the
 menu in all of the departments with
 the exception of the CUSTOMER SERVICE
 CENTER.  To get the menu in PEOPLE
 CONNECTION, press the F7 key.

 Once inside the Post Office, select
 "Read Waiting Mail."  The mail sent
 to you by other members will then
 appear.  Once you have read a piece
 of E-Mail, it will be removed from
 the Q-Link system.  E-Mail will also
 be automatically removed after 45
 days of the date sent.

 Sometimes you receive E-Mail that is
 longer than your screen can display
 at one time.  If this happens, you
 may "scroll" the text by using the up
 and down <CRSR> keys, located on the
 lower right hand corner of your
 keyboard.

 If you see the "MAIL" flag but Q-Link
 says "No mail waiting" when you try
 to read your mail, simply send mail
 to yourself, then read the mail.
 This will "unlock" the "MAIL" flag
 and cause it to disappear.

 If you are using a version 3 or
 version 4 Q-Link Program disk, you
 may save your mail by pressing F7 and
 choosing "Save mail" after you read
 it.  You will need to put a formatted
 disk (not your Q-Link Program Disk)
 into the disk drive and select a
 filename for the mail.  This filename
 must be at least one character and no
 more than 16 characters in length.
 Numbers, lowercase letters, a period
 and/or a slash may be used.  Mail
 saved in this manner can be read
 offline using any sequential file
 reader or word processor.  There is a
 sequential reader/printer, SPRINT, on
 the versions 3 and 4 Q-Link Program
 Disk or downloadable from the "Q-Link
 Utilities" section in the COMMODORE
 SOFTWARE SHOWCASE's Software
 Libraries under "Text File Readers."
