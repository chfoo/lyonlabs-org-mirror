 HOW TO SAVE SCREEN TEXT

 Text or postings on message boards in
 all the departments other than PEOPLE
 CONNECTION may be saved to disk.  You
 may also save dialogue in conference
 rooms.

 Insert a formatted disk (other than
 your Q-Link Program Disk) into your
 disk drive.  Make sure all off the
 text is in your "buffer"; the
 checkmark at the top right corner of
 your screen will disappear.

 Press F3 to start the save.  You will
 then be asked for a filename.  This
 filename must be at least one
 character and no more than sixteen
 characters in length.  Numbers,
 lowercase letters, a period and/or a
 slash may be used.  Press <RETURN>
 after you've typed the filename.
 You'll then be reminded not to save
 files onto your Q-Link Program Disk;
 press <RETURN> to continue.

 When you save more than one file with
 the same name, each additional file
 will automatically be appended to the
 existing file.

 SAVING IN CONFERENCE ROOMS

 When you are saving dialogue in a
 conference room, your buffer will
 hold a maximum of 80 lines at a time.
 However, you may wish to save more
 often than every 80 lines and later,
 edit the file to remove the duplicate
 lines.

 To view the files later, use any
 sequential file reader/printer, or
 word processor.  A sequential file
 reader, SPRINT, is included on all
 Q-Link V3 and V4 Program Disks.
 SPRINT may also be found and
 downloaded from the "Q-Link
 Utilities" section in COMMODORE
 SOFTWARE SHOWCASE's Software
 Libraries under "Text File Readers."
