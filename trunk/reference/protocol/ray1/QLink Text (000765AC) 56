 DOWNLOAD A SPECIFIC FILE 

 If you know the exact filename and 
 the uploader's exact screen name, you 
 can quickly download a file by 
 selecting the "Download a Specific 
 File" option from the "Software 
 Libraries" menu. Q-Link will ask you 
 to type in the name of the file to be 
 downloaded, and then the name of the 
 person who uploaded the file. 

 Q-Link will check to make sure the 
 file is available and then ask you to 
 insert a formatted disk. When you are 
 ready, press <RETURN> and the file 
 will be downloaded. If you have a 
 version 3 or 4 Q-Link Program Disk, a 
 bell on your computer will ring, to 
 tell you when the downloading is 
 complete. 

 Note: Please do not use the "Upload a 
 File" option in "Download a Specific 
 File" as this option does not work on 
 that menu.
