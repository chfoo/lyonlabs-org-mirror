 USING COMMODORE EQUIPMENT OVERSEAS

 Commodore cannot recommend or support
 the use of any Commodore-US
 manufactured computer product or any
 Europe made product in the U.S.

 It is recommended that you purchase a
 computer in the country which
 provides that same T.V. standard as
 needed. You could also bring an NTSC
 T.V. set and the proper converters if
 you must bring your present U.S. made
 computer. However, the T.V. set will
 not be able to receive foreign
 channels or stations.

 As a reminder, Commodore can not
 fulfill any warranty on a computer
 that is operated other than what it
 was originally designed for.

 Since COMMODORE has offices in many
 other countries, we do not maintain
 further information on the machines
 made and sold in those countries.
 Those machines are not made in the
 USA and we do not have access to
 parts, supplies or information on
 their machines. If you need further
 info, we suggest you contact
 COMMODORE in the country where you
 are going to for further assistance.

 We have had reports from users who
 claim to used there US computers with
 some form of a power transformer.
