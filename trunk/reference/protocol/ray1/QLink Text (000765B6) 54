 HOW TO UPLOAD FILES 

 If you would like to submit a file to 
 the software libraries, select 
 "Upload a File" from the "Software 
 Libraries" menu. 

 Choose the appropriate software 
 library and section of that library 
 to which you would like to upload. 
 Then select "Submit a New File for 
 This Area." You will be asked for the 
 name of the file you wish to upload. 
 This must be the exact name of the 
 file as it appears on the DIRECTORY 
 of that disk except that you must 
 type in the name in lowercase 
 letters. 

 Note: The option, "See Files in This 
 Area" is not functional. To see 
 public domain files, choose "Browse 
 the Libraries." 

 HINTS FOR UPLOADING 

 1) When uploading a text file or a 
 program to Q-Link, be sure to enter 
 the filename exactly as it appears on 
 the DIRECTORY of that disk (except 
 that the filename must be entered in 
 lowercase letters). 

 2) When entering the description of 
 the file/program to be uploaded, 
 Please be sure to include the 
 following: 

 - State that the file/program is in 
   the Public Domain. 

 - Include a good description of what 
 the file is; for example: 

  "The documentation file for..." 

  "This is a disk utility program that 
  gives you the options of..." 

  "This is the second of four files.." 

 3) Be sure you upload the program to 
 the appropriate Software Library. 

 Note: An uploaded file, will not 
 appear immediately. Files uploaded to 
 Q-Link are reviewed first.
