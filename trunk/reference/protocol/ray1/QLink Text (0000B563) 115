 RECOVERING PROGRAMS FROM DISKS

 There is no way to recover data and
 programs after you have formatted or
 headered a disk. There are however,
 programs like the "Disk Doctor" that
 allow you to go into the disk and
 read each block to try and retrieve
 data. Check in local software dealers
 for this third party program.
