 SENDING ELECTRONIC MAIL 

 To send electronic mail (E-Mail), 
 select "Q-Link Post Office" from one 
 of the many menus throughout Q-Link. 
 There is no Q-Link Post Office in the 
 CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER. 

 Once you select "Q-Link Post Office" 
 from the menu, you will have three 
 options: "Send an Online Message", 
 "Send Electronic Mail", or "Read 
 Waiting Mail."  Choose "Send 
 Electronic Mail." 

 You will then be asked for the screen 
 name of the person to whom you wish 
 to send the E-Mail.  Type in the 
 other Q-Link member's screen name and 
 press <RETURN>. 

 After Q-Link checks that you have 
 typed a valid screen name, you may 
 begin entering the text of your 
 E-Mail.  Q-Link E-Mail may be up to 
 45 lines long and up to 39 characters 
 to a line. Press <RETURN> once at the 
 end of each line. You will be told 
 when you have reached the maximum 
 number of lines. 

 When you're entering the text of the 
 mail, you will not be able to enter a 
 blank line; each line must have 
 something on it.  When you have 
 finished typing your mail, press 
 <RETURN> on a blank line. 

 You will then see the message "Your 
 mail has been posted."  This tells 
 you that the mail is now waiting for 
 its intended recipient who will see 
 the word "MAIL" appear in the bottom 
 corner of his or her screen and may 
 then go to a "Q-Link Post Office" to 
 read it. 

 E-Mail will remain online for a 
 period of 45 days or until it is 
 read.
