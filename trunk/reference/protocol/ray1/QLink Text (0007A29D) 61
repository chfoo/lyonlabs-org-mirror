 DOWNLOADING TOO LONG 

 Downloading speeds can vary for many 
 different reasons.  It could be the 
 number of users trying to use the 
 same access number that you are 
 using. It can also be a result of 
 other members trying to download the 
 same file. 

 Switching access numbers in your area 
 may help. Select "Access Numbers" in 
 the "Members' Online Guide" in 
 CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER for a 
 complete list of the access numbers 
 in your area. 

 Also, excessive noise on the 
 telephone line, as well as errors 
 noted during error-checks, will cause 
 the Q-Link to resend data, which will 
 increase the download time.  These 
 errors can be caused by peripherals 
 connected to the disk drive (such as 
 a second disk drive or printer). 
 An answering machine or cordless 
 phone on your telephone line may 
 cause the same problem.
