 SENDING ONLINE MESSAGES 

 To send an online message (OLM), you 
 need to go to the "Q-Link Post 
 Office."  You will find a "Q-Link 
 Post Office" on many of the menus 
 in each of the Q-Link departments, 
 with the exception of the CUSTOMER 
 SERVICE CENTER. 

 Once you select "Q-Link Post Office" 
 from the menu, you will have three 
 options: "Send an Online Message", 
 "Send Electronic Mail", or "Read 
 Waiting Mail."  Choose "Send 
 an Online Message." 

 You will then be asked for the screen 
 name of the person to whom you wish 
 to send the message.  Type in the 
 screen name and press <RETURN>. 

 After Q-Link checks to be sure that 
 you have typed a valid screen name 
 and that the person is currently 
 online, you may begin entering the 
 text of your message, which may be up 
 to 15 lines long.  You will receive 
 a notification when you reach this 
 limit. 

 When you're entering the text of 
 the message, you will not be able to 
 type a blank line; each line must 
 have something on it.  When you 
 are finished typing your message, 
 press <RETURN> on a blank line. This 
 will tell Q-Link that you are 
 finished. 

 Sometimes other members may be in a 
 section of Q-Link that will not allow 
 them to receive your OLM; you may try 
 again in a few minutes or send 
 E-Mail. Also, some online games do 
 not allow the sending of messages 
 during the game so you may have to 
 wait for a response.
