 DISK ERROR MESSAGES


 If you receive a disk error message
 from Q-Link, indicating that the disk
 is not formatted or does not have
 enough room for the file you wish to
 download, you will need to clear the
 message by turning the drive off and
 back on again. This will "reset" it.
 Then press <RETURN> to continue with
 the downloading process.
