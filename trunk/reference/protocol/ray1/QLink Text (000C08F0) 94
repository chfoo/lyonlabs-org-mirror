  COMMODORE/FEDERAL EXPRESS ANNOUNCE
UNPRECEDENTED CUSTOMER SERVICE PROGRAM


West Chester, PA., April 19, 1990 --
Commodore Business Machines, Inc.
today announced the establishment of
Commodore Express(TM), a new
24-hour toll-free "helpline" and
door-to-door customer service
program. The service is being offered
to new Amiga 500 owners in the U.S. in
cooperation with Federal Express
Corporation.

"Commodore is dedicated to customer
satisfaction," said Jim Reeder,
Commodore vice president for customer
satisfaction. "Commodore Express
is the first of a number of innovative
new services to be offered by
Commodore in support of that
commitment."

Commodore Express is part of an
aggressive new customer service
package designed with the home
computer user in mind. The program
was developed by Commodore in
conjunction with the company's recent
introduction of the Amiga 500 into
the consumer channel.

The comprehensive program includes:

* A 24-hour toll-free "helpline"
  service offering new Amiga 500
  owners the availability of ongoing
  assistance in setting up and
  operating their Amiga 500s; and

* Free pick-up and return computer
  delivery for in-warranty repairs.

Commodore Express' free pick-up and
return service applies to in-warranty
repairs only and requires
proof-of-purchase. This program will
be made available to all Amiga 500
owners in the U.S. who purchased their
computer after January 1, 1990.

"Setting up and operating a computer
can be intimidating, especially for
new users," Reeder said, adding that
even the simplest manual is often too
technical. "Commodore Express makes
the prospect of owning a computer
easier by providing home users with
ongoing service and support that
lasts long after the sale."

Further details regarding this program
are available by contacting
Commodore's Customer Satisfaction
Department at 1200 Wilson Drive,
West Chester, PA 19380.

Commodore Business Machines, Inc.,
based in West Chester, Pa.,
manufactures and markets a complete
line of computers and peripherals for
the business, education, government
and consumer markets.

The multi-tasking Amiga line includes
the Commodore Amiga 500(TM), the
Commodore Amiga 2000(TM) and three
enhanced products: The Commodore Amiga
2000HD(TM), the Commodore Amiga
2500(TM) and the Commodore Amiga 2500
