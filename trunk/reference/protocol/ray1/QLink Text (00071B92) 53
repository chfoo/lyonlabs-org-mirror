 POSTING MESSAGES ON MESSAGE BOARDS 

 Q-Link's message boards were designed 
 to be easy to use.  To post a message 
 for other Q-Link members to read, go 
 to one of the many message boards on 
 the Q-Link system and select "Start a 
 new topic." 

 You will be asked for the subject of 
 your message.  This subject line may 
 be no longer than 30 characters. 

 After you enter the subject of the 
 message, you may begin composing the 
 text of the message. 

 While typing the text of your 
 message, you may use the cursor keys 
 to position the cursor, the insert 
 and delete keys, and the return key. 
 There are also a number of special 
 editing features available by 
 pressing F7.  Using the menu you get 
 when you press F7, you will be able 
 to delete lines, insert text, etc. 

 When you have finished composing your 
 message, press F7 and choose "Send 
 message to Q-Link."  Q-Link will tell 
 you when your message has been sent. 
 Other members may now view and 
 respond to your message. 

 To respond to a message posted by 
 another Q-Link member, press F7 and 
 choose "Add a message to this topic" 
 after reading the original message. 
 Type your response using the 
 directions above for posting a 
 message. The original message will 
 now have "(R)" at the end of the 
 subject line.  Any response that has 
 another response after it will also 
 have the "(R)."  The number of 
 responses to an original message will 
 be indicated in its subject line. For 
 example, if a message has three 
 responses to it, there will be "(R3)" 
 at the end of its subject line. 

 Another option available to you after 
 reading a message is to "Read message 
 after date."  This will allow you to 
 view all responses after a date which 
 you specific by following the 
 prompts.
