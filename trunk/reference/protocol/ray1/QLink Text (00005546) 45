 UPLOAD A FILE - FREE 

 If you would like to submit a file to 
 the "Software Libraries," select 
 "Upload a File" from the "Software 
 Libraries" menu. 

 Choose the appropriate software 
 library and section of that library 
 to which you would like to upload. 
 Then select "Submit a New File for 
 This Area." You will be asked for the 
 name of the file you wish to upload. 
 This must be the exact name of the 
 file as it appears on the DIRECTORY 
 of that disk except that you must 
 type in the name in lowercase 
 letters. 

 Note: The option, "See Files in This 
 Area" is not functional. To see 
 public domain files, choose "Browse 
 the Libraries."
