 HINTS AND TIPS ON SEARCHING

 1) The "*" symbol is used in file
 subject lines to indicate files
 recommended by the SysOps. Add this
 character to your search phrase to
 get only these select files.

 2) If there are too many files found
 try using the "New This Week" or "New
 This Month" options to narrow your
 search.

 3) When searching for files from a
 particular uploader always include
 any spaces which appear in their
 screen names.

 4) The system is not case sensitive:
 It doesn't matter if you use upper or
 lower case letters.

 5) Don't forget that different people
 see things differently... some people
 may call it a "word scramble game",
 others a "word unscramble game".
 Using "OR" can help; "scramble or
 unscramble" can find both.

 6) Numbers are ignored by the search
 system unless they have a decimal
 point or letter/number combination
 (such as "1.3" or "C64").

 7) Search words must be 3 or more
 characters long.

 8) When using the "New This Week" or
 "New this Month" options, you can
 press return with no search phrase
 and g¥t a list, or count how many
 files have been added, of the newest
 files.
