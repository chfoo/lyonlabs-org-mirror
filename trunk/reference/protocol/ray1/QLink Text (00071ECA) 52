 HOW TO USE FUNCTION KEYS 

 Unlike most online services, Q-Link 
 is menu driven and therefore, you 
 don't have to memorize a complex 
 series of commands. All of Q-Link's 
 features and functions are at your 
 fingertips through your function 
 keys. 

 These function keys are the F1, F3, 
 F5 and F7 keys on your Commodore 
 computer.  They are your online 
 "tools" and allow you to select 
 options from menus, move between 
 departments, clear your screen of 
 text and menus, and more. 

 Function key 1 (F1): allows you to 
 select an item on any Q-Link menu. 

 Function key 3 (F3): allows you to 
 save the text on your screen onto a 
 a formatted disk. This works in all 
 departments of Q-Link except PEOPLE 
 CONNECTION. It is also used while 
 playing online games to select either 
 playing or chatting mode. For more 
 on saving text, press F5 and select 
 "How to Save Screen Text." 

 Function key 5 (F5): allows you to 
 "back out" of a menu or series of 
 menus. Press the F5 key to clear 
 menus or text from your screen. 

 Function key 7 (F7): displays the 
 menu of items and functions available 
 in that service or department. It is 
 also a "help" key that will display 
 information about how a function 
 works. 

 Once you have a Q-Link menu on your 
 screen, use your <CRSR> up/down key 
 to move the cursor between items on a 
 menu. The cursor will appear as a 
 check mark on Q-Link menus. If you 
 have difficulty moving the check 
 mark, check your <SHIFT/LOCK> key.
