 Q-LINK UTILITIES 

 The Q-Link Utilities libraries 
 provide you with easy access to 
 programs that will help you get the 
 most out of Q-Link and its public 
 domain libraries. 

 The utilities are divided into four 
 sections: 

 * Q-Link Color change program 
 * Text File Readers 
 * Download Utilities 
 * Music and Graphic Utilities 

 Each section has a description about 
 the utilities, why they are used and 
 when to use them. 

 The Q-Link Colors program allows you 
 to change the colors of the screen, 
 text and menus in all Q-Link 
 departments. 

 The Text File Rea* Music and Graphic Utilities 

 Each section has a description about 
 the utilities, why they are used and 
 when to use them. 

 The Q-Link Colors program allows you 
 to change the colors of the screen, 
 text and menus in all Q-Link 
 departments. 

 The Text File Readers can be used to 
 read your Q-Link E-Mail, messages 
 saved to your disk, documentation 
 and other text you download from 
 Q-Link. 

 Download Utilities are used on 
 certain files in the public domain 
 libraries. These utilities are used 
 to separate or expand files that 
 end in ".arc", ".lnx", ".lbr" or 
 begin with "q/". 

 Music and Graphics Utilities allow 
 you to "play" music files and to 
 display or print graphic files. 

 For your convenience, utilities 
 which contain more than one file 
 have been combined. When you download 
 these utilities, they automatically 
 are broken up into two or more files 
 on your disk. This assures that you 
 get everything you need in one, easy 
 step. Where documentation on a 
 program is available, it has been 
 included as part of the utility.
