 LIBRARY HIGHLIGHTS 

 The "Library Highlights" section is 
 your direct link to the newest and 
 most popular software in the "Public 
 Domain Software Libraries". 

 The area includes four special 
 libraries: 

 * NEW THIS WEEK LIBRARIES 
 * WEEKLY UPLOAD GUIDES 
 * TOP SOFTWARE PICKS 
 * ALL TIME TOP DOWNLOADS 

 NEW THIS WEEK LIBRARIES 

 The "New this Week Libraries" allows 
 you to browse and download the most 
 recent additions to the libraries. 
 The software is grouped by major 
 library categories. 

 You may browse the new additions by 
 filename or subject heading. 
 Commodore 128 software is easily 
 identified by the addition of 
 "(C128)" to the subject line. 

 These libraries are updated every 
 Friday and include all files 
 uploaded to the "Public Domain 
 Software Libraries" during the prior 
 week. 

 WEEKLY UPLOAD GUIDES 

 The "Weekly Upload Guides" are 
 downloadable text files containing 
 the COMPLETE descriptions of all the 
 files uploaded in the previous week. 

 Each Major catagory holds both the 
 C-64 and C-128 Software Guides. The 
 C-64 and C-128 Files are identified 
 in the subject line of the library 
 listing. 

 After downloading these files you 
 can look at the complete 
 descriptions of file off-line. These 
 files can be viewed and/or printed 
 using SPRINT or most popular 
 word processing programs. The files 
 are divided by major library 
 categories and are updated each 
 Friday. 

 TOP SOFTWARE PICKS 

 The files in this area match the 
 "Top Software Picks" which appear 
 each month in Q-Link's Update 
 newsletter. They represent some of 
 the most popular software in the 
 Q-Lin-‚b¥‰É…É¥•Í¹úý?es can also be found 
 under "Library Highlights" for 
 each Special Interest Group in 
 the "Commodore Community."
