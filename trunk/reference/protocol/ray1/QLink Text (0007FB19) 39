 BROWSE THE LIBRARIES 

 It's easy to get programs from our 
 software libraries. 

 If you don't have a specific title in 
 mind, selecting  one of the library 
 browse features allows you to browse 
 through all the libraries to find 
 items that are of interest to 
 you. 

 For your convenience the librarie
 find the software for the computer 
 (or mode) you want to use. 

 Once you have selected which computer 
 you wish to find files for you will 
 find the libraries organized by the 
 same major categories found in the 
 CIN Support Groups area. 

 After choosing the library you are 
 interested in and selecting the 
 appropriate software category, you 
 can then choose to see the files by 
 filename or by subject name. The 
 filename is the name that the 
 uploader gave to the file. The 
 subject name more clearly defines 
 the software. 

 Either choice will give you a menu of 
 upload dates. Browse through all the 
 date categories. Move the checkmark 
 to the appropriate file and press F1. 
 The descriptio¶ of the file will be 
 displayed on your screen. 

 After reading the description, press 
 F7 for the download menu. You'll be 
 able to read or post comments about 
 the program, or download the program. 

 Remember that you will need a 
 formatted disk (other than your 
 Q-Link Program Disk) to receive the 
 file.
