 HOW TO SEARCH THE LIBRARIES

 From the Search Menu, you'll need to
 choose which of the library sections
 you'd like to search. You'll choose
 based on the computer and operating
 system.

 As an example, let's look for a word
 game for the C64 computer. First
 we'll select the C64 Library search
 area and then "Search All Files".
 This will search every file in the
 C64 libraries, new and old.

 Next, we'll enter the search phrase
 "word game". This will search for
 files which have the two words "word"
 and "game". After pressing return the
 system telT.ªÍ?¢¡…Ñ?¢¡•É•?º•É•?ŠŠjZŒ¡Œ>x KD4
 files found and asks us to "Please
 use more specific search words".

 Let's decide to go for word games
 which have you unscramble words. We
 can do this by changing the search
 phrase to "word game unscramble".
 This will give us a list of 3 files
 we can look at and download.

 TOOLS FOR SEARCHING: AND, OR, NOT

 You can use "AND" to join words and
 phrases together such as "word and
 game" shown above. Generally the
 "and" is understood to be there when
 two or more words are put in the
 search phrase. In the above example,
 we could have entered "word and game
 and unscrthe
 system tells us that there were 114
 files found and asks us to "Please
 use more specific search words".

 we could have entered "word and game
 and unscramble" and received the same
 result.

 Using "OR" will allow you to find
 words which contain one or both of
 two specified words. Continuing our
 example we could expand our search by
 using the phrase "scramble or
 unscramble". This will find files
 with either the word "scramble" or
 "unscramble".

 Finally we can use the "NOT" word to
 narrow our search. For example if we
 use the phrase "scramble not game" we
 find two files, neither of which is a
 game.
