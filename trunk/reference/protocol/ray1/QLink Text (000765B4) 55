 DOWNLOADING 

 After selecting the software library 
 in which you are interested, you will 
 have the option to view the files by 
 filename or by subject. The 
 "filename" option will display a 
 listing of the exact filenames. The 
 "subject" option will display a 
 listing of subject headings. 

 Either choice will give you a menu of 
 upload dates. Select a date category 
 by pressing F1 and then move the 
 check mark to the file you wish to 
 download; press F1. The description 
 of the file will be displayed on your 
 screen. 

 After reading the description, press 
 F7 for the download menu. You'll be 
 able to read or post comments about 
 the file, or download the file. 

 To download the file, select 
 "Download This File" and follow the 
 prompts. 

 You will need a formatted disk (other 
 than your Q-Link Program Disk) to 
 receive the file. 

 It is a good idea to thoroughly read 
 file descriptions and the comments 
 posted by other Q-Link members, who 
 often give beneficial hints and 
 opinions. Also, it is useful to take 
 notes on such things as how to use or 
 LOAD the file, for later reference.
