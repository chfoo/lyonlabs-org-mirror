You'll choose based on theZÉÑ3w KD computer and operating system. As aZ1äAÉ4w KDn example, let's look for a word game ZqÖ±ç5w KDfor the C64 computer. First we'll seleZåã6w KDct the C64 Library search area and theZaéQá7w KDn "Search All Files". This will searchZaÑÅ8w KD every file in the C64 libraries, new ZÒçÖ9w KDand old. Next, we'll enter the searchZAä°ä:w KD phrase "word game". This will search ZÒç°å;w KDfor files which have the two words "woZQÉAç<w KMrd" and "game". After pressing return Z°éaÖ=w KDthe system tells us that there were 11Zå°å>x KD4 files found and asks us to "Please use more specific search words". Let's decide to go for word games which haZ°ÖAÇ?x KDve you unscramble words. We can do this by changing the search phrase to "word game unscramble". This will give usZ±å!à@x KD a list of 3 files we can look at and download. TOOLS FOR SEARCHING: AND, OR, NOT You can use "AND" to join wordZ—çÅâAx KMs and phrases together such as "word and game" shown above. Generally the "and" is understood to be there when twZÅÑAèBx KDo or more words are put in the search phrase. In the above example, we could have entered "word and game and unscrZ·ÇqèCz KDamble" and received the same result. Using "OR" will allow you to find words which contain one or both of two spZ±ãÒäDz KDecified words. Continuing our example we could expand our search by using the phrase "scramble or unscramble". ThiZ1á!ÉEz KDs will find files with either the word "scramble" or "unscramble". Finally we can use the "NOT" word to narrow oZ°å1ÑFz KDur search. For example if we use the phrase "scramble not game" we find two files, neither of which is a game.  Z¡èÅÅGz KE        <PRESS F5 FOR MENU>ZÅçH{ KC@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@AwMjZÒÉ·ÖI{ KD HINTS AND TIPS ON SEARCHING 1) The "Z1ÇaÑJ{ KD*" symbol is used in file subject lineZëå—âK{ KDs to indicate files recommended by theZ—à¡ÅL{ KD SysOps.

The model for most BibleZQã·ÄrH KDsocieties, the British and ForeignZaÖÒÜsH KDBible Society, was founded in 1804. ItsZaà¡àtH KDpurpose was to supply inexpensiveZaèÅáuH KDBibles or portions of the Bible,ZaåAàvH KD"without note or comment" in theZaèÅÄwH KDlanguages of the areas where BritishZëäåxH KDmissionaries were working. Although aZÅèÑyH KDshort-lived Catholic Bible Society wasZ!Ü!ÖzH KDbegun in Regensburg in 1805, whichZ!äQé{H KDprinted a German New Testament withZëèÅç|H KDPsalms, Bible societies have beenessentially Protestant enterprises. Bythe mid-19th century, they existed asZ°áé}H KDfar north as Scandinavia, in Russia tothe east, and in North America. TheAmerican Bible Society, an ecumenicalZQä—ç~H KDventure, was founded in 1816. The expansion of the work of thevarious societies, and the creation ofZ!àÅåH KDnew national societies brought aboutduplication of effort, especially inthe support of translators and inZÅçaèH KDdistribution. Hence, 20 societiesjoined in 1946 to form the United BibleSocieties. One of the best-known BibleZaÉ1ÜH KEsocieties is Gideons International,which places a copy of the Bible inhotel and motel rooms.

Ancient JewsZQÑAÑ%K KDand Christians believed theirZAåÅ&K KDScriptures to be inspired by God andZAÄç'K KDintended to guide all generations.  TheZÒã±Ä(K KDinterpretative method called MIDRASHZ·çÇ)K KDsought to make the biblical messageZ¡çà*K KDrelevant to the actual needs of theZ·á°ã+K KDcommunity, to remove obscurities andZ!á°ã,K KDcontradictions, to find fulfillments ofZÒäÒé-K KDprophecies, and to answer questions notZAáaÖ.K KDraised in the Bible by discoveringZÒâQè/K KDallegorical meanings.  This process isZqâaè0K KDseen in the DEAD SEA SCROLLS, theZ!Ö¡Ö1K KDparaphrases, or targums, of the OldTestament, and the writings of thephilosopher PHILO;  and it hasZã±è2K KDinfluenced New Testament theology.  TheRABBIS used midrash to settle legalproblems;  it appears in the TALMUD asZ±É¡á3K KDwell as in the Midrashim, orhomiletical commentaries. Christians were influenced both byZ·á—â4K KDJewish tradition and by philosopherswho explained Greek myths asallegories.  The Alexandrian scholarZëéQÖ5K KDORIGEN distinguished literal andallegorical meanings in the OldTestament, and his followers foundZAÇ¡ã6K KDthree or four ways to interpret aspecific text.  The school of Antioch,represented by commentators such asZaáëã7K KDTHEODORE OF MOPSUESTIA and the greatpreacher John CHRYSOSTOM, insisted onthe natural and literal meaning ofZ¡à±Å8K KDScripture.  During the Middle Ages theallegorical method largely prevailed. Z·Çqç9K KDModern Study.  During the RENAISSANCE,a revival of the study of Greek andLatin classics occurred that ledZ·éã:K KDChristian scholars to study Hebrew. Literary and historical criticism,which had been carried on in ancientZà±å;K KDtimes, now received a new impetus. Although the allegorical method neverdied out in Catholicism andZ!Éä<K KDProtestantism, the new learninginfluenced the study of the Bible, andin the 18th century the techniques ofZ±É!Ñ=K KDclassical studies began to be employedsystematically. Improved dictionariesand grammars were part of this process.Z°ä—â>K KDTextual criticism is an important partof biblical interpretation.  This isthe comparison of manuscripts of theZ1àé?K KDBible in the original languages andversions, including quotations byancient authors, to determine as nearlyZëé±Ç@K KDas possible the original wording. Literary criticism is the study of thedocument itself in comparison withZ1Å¡àAK KDother books--biblical andnonbiblical--to disclose the method,style, and purpose of the author;  hisZ·äÒÅBK KDidentity;  the written and oral sourceshe used;  and the date and place of thewriting.  This has led to theoriesZQè—äCK KDregarding sources of the Pentateuch andthe Gospels, the dating of Paul'sletters, and the distinctions betweenZ!ÇAÉDK KDparts of Isaiah. Form criticism studies the oraltradition behind a document.
