NEW & IMPROVED OMEGA-Q!

"Omega-Q," Q-Link's ultimate utility program, has been redesigned and significantly improved to give you more control over the management of your disks than ever before! Introduced last month as part of "Discover CIN," the new "Omega-Q II" is as easy to use as Q-Link, and as powerful as a dozen other programs combined!

This downloadable program automatically dissolves ARC, Self-Dissolving ARC, Library, Lynx, Arkive and SID music files. "Omega-Q II" also lets you easily view and print text files, format disks, scratch/unscratch, lock/unlock, copy and boot files -- and much more!

New features include:

* A greatly enhanced SEQ file reader that features word wrap and an option to ignore non-printable characters.

* An improved SEQ file printer that rivals the best. Customize top, bottom, left and right margins, page length and width to tailor documents to your own printer and tastes. You can number pages and print one or two columns to a page.

* The ability to read ASCII and format documents correctly.

* "Hot keys" for all menus. Users familiar with "Omega-Q" just press the first letter of an option to select it!

* A directory editor to completely reorder files on your disk. Alphabetize them, insert special separator lines, or quickly rename a file.

* An F7 option for disk statistics.

* The ability to dissolve multiple archives of any kind in one "batch."

* The familiar Q-Link bell at the end of a dissolve batch, the ability to boot Q-Link directly, more customization menus, and lots of other extras!

Download the exciting, new version of "Omega-Q" in the "Omega-Q Center," located in CIN's "Downloading Help" area.
