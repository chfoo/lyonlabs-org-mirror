 GENERAL/BEGINNERS' GROUP 

 The "General/Beginners'" Group 
 dedicates itself to helping people 
 get started in Commodore computing. 
 Hosted by QDL Laura and QDL Robert.

 APPLICATIONS GROUP 

 The Applications Group explores ways 
 to make your C64 or C128 work for 
 you, whether it's through word 
 processing or balancing a check book, 
 cataloging recipes or using spread 
 sheets. 

 CP/M 

 The CP/M Group explores the world of 
 CP/M on Commodore computers. This 
 older operating system still demands 
 respect and provides Commodore 
 owners, specifically C128 owners, 
 with a wealth of new opportunities to 
 explore. 

 GRAPHICS GROUP 

 Creative talents gather in the 
 Graphics Group to show everyone how 
 to have fun with computer graphics. 
 Animation, still life and other 
 computer art is not only enjoyable 
 but easy when you know the tricks you 
 can learn here. 

 GAME WORLD 

 Many people first became interested 
 in computers because the computers 
 games were so much fun and so 
 intriguing; they still are! The 
 members of the Game World Group 
 discuss and help each other with C64 
 and C128 games. 

 MUSIC ROOM 

 Whether it is music generated by the 
 C64 or C128, or hooking up the 
 computers to MIDIs, the Music Room 
 Group is where you can learn all 
 about computers and music.
