 FILE TYPES 

 To determine the filetype, you will 
 need to run the disk directory.  You 
 can do this by simply typing (while 
 offline): 

     LOAD "$",8      (Press <RETURN> 
     LIST            (Press <RETURN> 

 This will allow you to see the size 
 (the number of blocks) of each file, 
 the exact name of the file (with 
 spaces), and the type of file. 

 The exact name, with the correct 
 spelling, spaces and punctuation, is 
 very important when you reference a 
 filename. 

 The column on the right side of the 
 directory indicates the file type. 
 The only types that can be downloaded 
 from Q-Link are SEQ (sequential) and 
 PRG (program). 

 SEQ files are either text files that 
 require a sequential reader, such as 
 SPRINT or a word processor in order 
 to view them, or they are files that 
 have been altered in some way to make 
 uploading and downloading easier. 

 Note:  SPRINT may be found on 
 versions 3 and 4 Q-Link Program Disks 
 or in the "Features" section of NEWS 
 AND INFORNATION under "Auditorium 
 Archives". 

 PRG files are simply LOADed and RUN. 
 See the file "Program Will Not Run" 
 for information about using these 
 files. 

 Occasionally, you will see a file 
 that has an asterisk (*) in front of 
 the file type.  These files are known 
 as "splat" files and are caused by a 
 file not being completely written to 
 the disk, such as an incomplete 
 download. You will not be able to use 
 these files.
