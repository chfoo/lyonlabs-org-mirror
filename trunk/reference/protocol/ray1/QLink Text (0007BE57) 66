 HOW TO USE CONFERENCE ROOMS 

 These rooms are used for Special 
 Interest Group conferences, club 
 meetings, Tutoring Center classes, 
 and more. You will know you have 
 entered a conference room when you 
 see "You are now in the conference 
 area" at the top of your screen.  A 
 maximum of 23 people may be in a 
 conference room at one time. 

 Once you're in the conference room, 
 press the F7 key for a menu of 
 options. On the versions 3 and 4 
 Q-Link Program Disk, you have the 
 options of "Q-Link Post Office" and 
 "Identify Someone." 

 On all versions of the Q-Link Program 
 Disk, you have the option to "List 
 people in this conference room." 
 Choosing this option will let you see 
 the screen names of the other people 
 in the room with you. If the list is 
 too long, use the up and down <CRSR> 
 keys to scroll the list. You may keep 
 this list on the screen and still 
 participate in the room's discussion. 
 When someone enters or leaves the 
 room, the change will be displayed on 
 this list. 

 You may talk in a conference room in 
 the same way you talk in PEOPLE 
 CONNECTION: simply type what you 
 would like to say and press <RETURN>. 
 You may use the up and down <CRSR> 
 keys to scroll the screen and view 
 what other members have typed.  If 
 you have scrolled the screen up and 
 then someone types a message, you 
 will be automatically returned to the 
 bottom of the screen. 

 If you are using the "Q-Link Post 
 Office" while in a conference room, 
 you may not participate in the 
 discussion. To talk in the conference 
 room, you must have either the list 
 of people in the room or the "You are 
 now in the conference area" message 
 on the top of your screen. 

 Many groups which use conference 
 rooms use what is known as 
 "Conference Protocol." If protocol is 
 being used, the protocol information 
 will usually be displayed on your 
 screen just before you enter the 
 conference room. If the meeting is 
 being conducted using protocol, 
 please be sure that you use the 
 protocol to enable everyone to get 
 the most from the meeting. 

 To leave a conference room, press F5. 
 When asked if you want to leave the 
 conference room, type "Yes."
