 HOW TO FORMAT A DISK

 Formatting allows you to save files
 on a new disk.  It also creates the
 beginning of a directory of the files
 you save to that disk.  Here is how
 to format a disk:

 1. Turn on your computer, disk drive,
 and monitor.  If you are using a
 C128, hold down the Commodore key
 when you turn the computer on so you
 will boot up in C64 mode.

 2. Place the new disk you wish to
 format in the disk drive and close
 the drive door.

 3. Type the following command:

 OPEN 15,8,15,"N0:diskname,id":CLOSE 15
 and press <RETURN>.

 **(NOTE: "N0:... uses a ZERO and not
 the letter O)**

 The "diskname" is any name you wish
 to use for the disk, and can be as
 long as 16 characters.  The "id" is
 any two characters (the disk drive
 uses the "id" to identify the disk.
 An example of a diskname and id is:

             DOWNLOADS 1,01

 You will not see the flashing cursor
 while the disk drive is formatting
 the disk until it reaches and
 executes the CLOSE command.  A
 flashing DRIVE light after the
 formatting is complete indicates a
 disk error.  Check to see that the
 disk is properly notched, that the
 drive door is closed, and that the
 you typed the command correctly.

 NOTE: Formatting a disk will erase
 all existing files on the disk; you
 only need to format a disk the first
 time you use it.
