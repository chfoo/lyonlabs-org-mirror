 PROGRAMMERS' WORKSHOP 

 The Programmers' Workshop Group is 
 the place for C64 and C128 
 programmers to get help, explore new 
 languages, and give and receive 
 encouragement on that latest 
 programming project. 

 The Programmers' Workshop is also the 
 proud sponsor of the "COMAL TODAY" 
 area. COMAL is one of the few Public 
 Domain programming languages in the 
 United States. "COMAL Today", hosted 
 by Len Linsey, covers this exciting 
 programming language from top to 
 bottom.
