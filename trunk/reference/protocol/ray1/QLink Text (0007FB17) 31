 ABOUT THE CIN SYSOPS

 The SysOps (System Operators) are
 part of Q-Link's remote staff, and
 are responsible for the operation of
 the individual Support Groups. They
 generally assure that everything in
 the group, such as message boards and
 software libraries, is properly
 maintained.

 If you have a question about
 computing and don't know which group
 would handle it, just select
 "Hardware Support Groups" or
 "Software Support Groups" from the
 prior menu to get information on all
 the groups available.

 Each group has a weekly conference,
 given by a SysOp, on a variety of
 topics. All of the meetings are held
 in the CIN "Conference Center".
 You'll also find a complete list of
 each months conference in the
 "TONIGHT!" area of CIN.

 The SysOps are knowledgeable and
 genuinely enjoy helping members learn
 about computing.  So feel free to use
 the message boards and attend the
 conferences. They will welcome you
 and the opportunity to assist you.
