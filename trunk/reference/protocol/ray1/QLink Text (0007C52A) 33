 ABOUT THE SEARCH SYSTEM

 The library search system allows you
 to search all the files in a given set
 of software libraries. This gives you
 the ability to quickly locate specific
 files from the over 30,000 files
 available.

 With the Q-Link search system, you
 can search by:

 * subject
 * filename
 * uplre search words assigned
 to each library. For example, the disk
 utilities library online has the
 keywords "disk", "utility", and
 "application" assigned. A list of
 these common keywords are available
 in the "Sample Keywords" listoader name
 * keywords

 The keywords are search words assigned
 to each library. For example, the disk
 utilities library online has the
 keywords "disk", "utility", and
 "application" assigned. A list of
 these common keywords are available
 in the "Sample Keywords" list located
 on the prior menu.

 In addition, you can search by time
 period: new files this week, new files
 this month or all files in the
 library.

 The search system can display up to
 28 files. If more than 28 files are
 found you'll be asked to provide a
 more specific search phrase. You can
 do this by providing more words or by
 using conditional search words.
 You'll find more information on how
 to do this in the "How to Search the
 Libraries" area on the previous menu.
