 PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN 

 Reading the file description of a 
 file that you wish to download will 
 give you instructions on how to LOAD, 
 RUN, and use a file. Also, browsing 
 through the comments on a file 
 description can help with problems 
 you may encounter. 

 You can save file descriptions and 
 their comments by pressing the F3 
 key, and following the prompts. (See 
 the "How to Save Screen Text" file.) 

 However, you may try the two most 
 frequently used LOAD commands and see 
 if they will work. Type: 

 LOAD"filename",8   (Press <RETURN>) 

 Then type: 

 RUN                (Press <RETURN>) 

 If that does not work, type: 

 LOAD"filename",8,1 (Press <RETURN>) 

 Then type: 

 RUN                (Press <RETURN>) 

 Turn off your computer and disk drive 
 before and after each attempt. 

 Sometimes disconnecting peripherals 
 will help. Modems, fast load 
 cartridges and printers may cause 
 programs not to load or run properly.
