McDonald Observatory 

McDonald Observatory, near Fort Davis,
Tex., was founded in 1938 in
affiliation with the University of
Texas. It is the site of several
powerful telescopes, including 107-in
(2.7-m), 82-in (2.1-m), 36-in (0.91-m),
and 30-in (0.76-m) optical telescopes
and a 16-ft (4.9-m) dish for radio
astronomy in the millimeter range of
the spectrum. Work has been done at the
observatory on the polarization of
light by interstellar matter; galactic
superclusters; flare stars; cataclysmic
variables; stellar brightness; the
rotation period of Uranus and Neptune;
the atmosphere of one of Jupiter's
satellites, Io; and optical and
photometric technology.
