 ABOUT THE SUPPORT GROUPS 

 The CIN Support Groups are dedicated 
 to all those people who own, use or 
 are interested in Commodore 
 computing. 

 The "Computing Support Groups" 
 specialize in specific areas of 
 interest to Commodore enthusiasts 
 while the "Hardware Support Groups" 
 are more oriented towards seeing what 
 the computers themselves can do and 
 getting into the hardware of the 
 systems. 

 While each Support Group grows and 
 changes to meet the needs of their 
 members you'll find several standard 
 features in each group. 

 NEWS AND EVENTS 

 This area allows you to keep on top 
 of the current news and events of the 
 group. Included here is a schedule of 
 the current month's group 
 conferences. 

 MESSAGE BOARDS 

 The message boards in each group is 
 where Q-Link members can read and 
 post messages. Many people find these 
 extremely helpful in keeping up to 
 date on the latest information  as 
 well as getting help on that vexing 
 problem. 

 ARTICLES 

 The articles section contains 
 magazine-type articles dealing with a 
 variety of topics. The SysOps write 
 many of the articles, but feel free 
 to contact the SysOp to see how YOUR 
 article might be added to the area. 

 SOFTWARE LIBRARIES 

 This area is probably one of the most 
 popular areas in each group. The area 
 contains each group's portion of the 
 COMMODORE INFORMATION NETWORK's 
 Software Libraries. These libraries 
 are one of the largest collections of 
 public domain software available. 

 ABOUT THE GROUP 

 Here you can find specific 
 information about each group and its 
 SysOps. There is also an area where 
 you can join the group. While the 
 groups are open to everyone, the 
 registered members often have a 
 chance to receive special notices of 
 upcoming events. 

 LIBRARY HIGHLIGHTS 

 This area has highlights of the 
 group's software libraries including 
 downloadable listings of recent 
 additions and lists of files which 
 are recommended by the SysOps.
