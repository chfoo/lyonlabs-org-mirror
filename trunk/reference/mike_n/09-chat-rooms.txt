Chat Rooms
==========

Live chat rooms are accessed from the People Connection.  

Special commands can be typed into the command line while in a chat room.
Some of these are available to staff members only.  Commands begin with
either "//" or "=q" followed by the command and any arguments required.

Staff-Only Commands:
  //sysmsg <message>
    Sends a System OnLine Message (instant message) to all users.

  //kill <handle>
    Terminate's the user's session.  

  //tos <handle>
  //bump <handle>
    Terminates the user's session.  The message, "You have violated the TOS
    and your session has been terminated, Press F5 to return to BASIC" will
    be displayed.

  //reboot
    Shuts down the server, ending the Java process.  This is actually an exit --
    something else must restart the Java process again.

  //test
    ?

Commands for All Users:
  //who
    Lists all handles in the current chat room.

  //msg <handle> <message>
    Sends an OnLine Message (instant message) to a user.

  //nick <handle>
    If the user has multiple accounts, this command allows the user to
    immediate change to another account (handle).


Vendor Chat Rooms
=================

Live chat is primarily done in the People Connection.  Chat that happens in
the People Connection is not stored in the database, aside from activity
logging in the `room_log` table.  The rooms available in the People Connection
are also not stored in the database.

However, it appears that a chat area can be attached to any menu.  When a
row in the `toc` table exists whose associated `entry_types`.`entry_type`=139
(CHAT), the server will look in the `vendor_rooms` table for a room associated
with the reference_id.

  `vendor_rooms`
    room            Name of the chat room
    reference_id    Foreign key to `toc`.`reference_id` and 
                    `entry_types`.`reference_id`

If no room for the `reference_id` exists in the `vendor_rooms` table, the
system appears to enter an unknown state.  The user's QLink client will hang
but the server will not clean up the user as disconnected, making it impossible
for the user to login again without rebooting the server.

If the room exists, the screen will clear and say "You are now in the
conference area."  The user can now chat in the room.  Pressing F5 will 
prompt to leave the conference area.  Pressing F7 will give the menu:

  Q-Link Post Office
  List users in this conference area
  Identify someone
  
The "post office" and "list users" appear to work.  

"Identify someone" works as expected if the user is not a staff member
(`users`.`staff_ind`='N').  In this case, the user's location is displayed.
However, if the user is a staff member, it always reports Cedar Rapids, IA 
as the location.  This might be by design.This is found in
org.jbrain.qlink.state.AbstractChatState.

Command line options available in People Connection like "//who" do not
appear to work in vendor chat rooms.
