Message Bases
=============

QLink users can send messages to each other on public message bases.  Each
message base is represented by a row in the `toc` table, whose associated
`entry_type` is 0x01 in the `entry_types` table.

To find all of the message bases in QLink:

  SELECT * FROM TOC WHERE REFERENCE_ID IN (
    SELECT REFERENCE_ID FROM ENTRY_TYPES WHERE ENTRY_TYPE=1
  );
  
All messages for all message bases are stored in the `messages` table:
  
  `messages`
    message_id        Primary key.  Auto-increments.
    reference_id      ?
    parent_id         If this is a new thread, 0.
                      If this is a reply, key to `messages`.`reference_id`
                      of the parent message
    base_id           Foreign key to the `toc`.`reference_id`
    title             Title of the message
    author            Author's handle (not ID)
    text              Body of the message.  Oddly, this includes the headers:
                      """
                      SUBJ: test topic                       
                      FROM: Mnaberez    12/26/2007 S# 534
                      Text entered by user here
                      """ 
    date              Datetime created
    replies           Number of replies to this message

The reference_id is computed in org.jbrain.qlink.db.DBUtils but it's still
not clear how this works.
