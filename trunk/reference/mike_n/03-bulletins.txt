Bulletins
=========

Bulletins are displayed after the user logs in, before the main menu
is displayed.

  `bulletin`
    bulletin_id     Primary key.  Auto-increments.
    text            Text to display in the bulletin.
    start_date      Datetime
    end_date        Datetime
    approved        enum('Y','N')

This query finds the bulletin(s) to display (org.jbrain.qlink.state.MainMenu.java):

  SELECT text from bulletin 
  WHERE start_date<now() AND end_date>now() AND approved='Y' 
  ORDER BY start_date DESC

If there is more than one row returned by the query, the bulletin text for each 
will be shown to the user in order.
