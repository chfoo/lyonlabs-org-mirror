Email
=====

Users can send email to each other (local to QLink).  These are stored in the
`email` table.

To send a message:
  Enter People Connection and then press F7
  Select "Q-Link Post Office"
  Select "Send E-Mail to someone's mailbox"
  Enter the recipient's username
  Enter the message and then RETURN on a blank line to send.

When a message is sent, a row is inserted into the `emails` table:

  `email`
    email_id        Primary key.  Auto-increments.
    recipient_id    Foreign key to `accounts`.`account_id` of recipient
    sender_id       Foreign key to `accounts`.`account_id` of sender
    recipient       Always NULL. (?)
    sender          Always NULL. (?)
    subject         Always NULL. (?)
    body            Body of the message.  Oddly, this includes the headers:
                    """
                    Mail From:  Mnaberez
                    Date:  Wednesday 26-Dec-2007 17:21 PST
                    Text entered by user here
                    """
    unread          enum(Y/N)
    received_date   Datetime.  This is actually when the email was sent.

In order to see if any email is waiting, the user must enter the 
Q-Link Post Office and select "Read Waiting Mail".  When mail is read,
the `unread` enum changed from 'Y' to 'N'.  

There appears to be no way for a user to go back and read messages 
already read, nor is there a way to delete email rows from the database.
