Files
=====

Each file in the system must have an associated row in `toc`.  To add a new file,
first create a row in `toc`:
  
  `toc`
    toc_id          Primary key.  Auto-increments.
    menu_id         500
    reference_id    805
    title           Title of the menu item, "Q-Link Sample Item"

The file data itself is stored in the `files` table.  The `files`.`reference_id`
is a foreign key to `toc`.reference_id.

  `files`
    file_id         Primary key.  Auto-increments.
    reference_id    Foreign key to the `reference_id` column in the `toc` table, 
                    or 805 from the example in `toc` above.
    name            Filename.  Should be Commodore 16-character compatible(?).
    filetype        Commodore filetype.  Presumably PRG, SEQ(?)
    description     Description fo the file
    data            Binary file contents
