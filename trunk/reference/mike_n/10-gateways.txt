Gateways
========

QLink has the ability to relay a telnet connection to the Commodore
client.  This is called a Gateway.

The primary limitation is that the QLink client on the Commodore is
line-oriented, not character oriented, and does not appear to support any
popular terminal emulations.

It appears that a Gateway can be attached to any menu.  When a row in
the `toc` table exists whose associated `entry_types`.`entry_type`=133
(GATEWAY), the server will look in the `gateways` table for a gateway 
associated with the reference_id.

  `gateways`
    address         IP address or hostname (both tested)
    port            Port to connect with (telnet is normally 23)
    gateway_id      Foreign key to `toc`.`reference_id` and 
                    `entry_types`.`reference_id`
                    
Several servers were tested with success:
  maintainable.com:25 (SMTP) responded to commands correctly
  mud.zeemud.org:4000 prompted for name and displayed it back
  rkbbs.net:23 prompted for name and displayed it back

One server, nyx10.nyx.net:23, displayed garbage on the Commodore client and
then was unresponsive.  However, it works fine on a Unix telnet client.
This was probably an escape sequence for terminal detection.  We should
investigate this further.  We should also determine what characters are safe
to send to the QLink client and filter those that are not.

The gateway code is found in org.jbrain.qlink.state.GatewayState.
