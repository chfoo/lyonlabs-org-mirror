    country           USA
    email             Always NULL.  not implemented?
    create_date       Datetime
    last_access       Datetime
    last_update       Datetime

  `accounts`
    account_id        Primary key.  Auto-increments.
    primary_ind       enum('Y','N') -- Primary Account?
    staff_ind         enum('Y','N') -- Staff Account?
    user_id           Foreign key to the `users` table
    active            Account active/enabled?  (enum Y/N)
                      Not clear what this is used for since removing
                      an account actually deletes the row.
    handle            User's handle (10 characters)
    create_date       Datetime
    last_access       Datetime
    last_update       Datetime

Primary Account
  A User can have many Accounts.  When the user logs on to QLink,
  a menu is presented, "Select user name to sign on with:".  If the user has
  only one account, this menu is not presented.
  
  Each User has one "Primary Account", indicated by `accounts`.`primary_ind`='Y'.  
  Other accounts the User has are called "sub-accounts". This significance is
  not yet understood.

Staff Account
  Accounts with `accounts`.`staff_ind`='Y' are QLink Staff Member accounts.
  These accounts have privileges beyond those of normal accounts.  See
  09-chat-room.txt for examples.

Notes
  On QLink, the user can modify his/her account information by
  going to Customer Service -> Account/User Name Maintenance

  A user can delete his/her accounts, but the user must always have
  at least one account.

  Certain handles are reserved and cannot be registered.  These are stored
  in the `reserved_names` table.
  
  The validation rules for a handle is stored by
  state.AbstractAccountState.validateNewAccount().

  Refer to UserManager.java

Issues
  There is not an easy way to tell if a user is logged in to QLink. The only
  way currently is to try to actually connect to the QLink server using the
  QLink protocol and attempt to login. This is problematic also because it
  will update `users`.`last_access`.
